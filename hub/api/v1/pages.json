The reason for using these submodules is described in Internal vs. Public Hubs. This guide explains how to work with them. If you're an 18F team member: You have access to the private repositories referenced by these submodules; follow these directions to begin working with them. Otherwise: You do not need to use git submodules to work with the Hub. However, if you wish to set up your own private submodules, this guide may prove helpful. Initializing the submodules Since the submodules are optional, the ./go development commands do not manage them. To import the submodules into the project: $ git submodule init $ git submodule update What just happened? Submodules are essentially separate git repositories nestled within your clone of the Hub repository. If you cd _data/private or cd _pages/private, you'll find a .git directory, and any git commands you run will pertain to that repository, not the Hub repository. How do these submodules work? Each branch of the Hub references specific SHA hashes from the master branch of each of these repositories. Fresh clones of the Hub repository will produce output based on the referenced versions of the submodules. These references will not change until explicitly updated. This allows the _data/private and _pages/private repositories to be updated independently of the Hub repository. Updating a submodule Changes made to a submodule in your local clone of the Hub will be reflected in the generated output, even if you do not explicitly update the current Hub branch to use the new data. This allows you to see the effects of data changes before: committing them to the submodule repository, pushing the changes upstream, and \"blessing\" the new submodule version by updating the Hub branch to refer to it explicitly. The easiest way to update a submodule is to: Enter the submodule directory: cd _data/private or cd _pages/private Create a new branch if desired: git checkout -b my-update Make the desired changes Rebuild the Hub and inspect the results Enter the submodule directory again, if necessary Commit the changes and push the branch upstream Pulling updates into the Hub Once changes to a submodule have been pushed upstream, they can be pulled into a local Hub repository by running: $ git submodule update --remote If there have been changes, the output of git status will reflect that the current branch is out-of-date with respect to the submodules: $ git status On branch master Changes not staged for commit: (use \"git add <file>...\" to update what will be committed) (use \"git checkout -- <file>...\" to discard changes in working directory) modified: _data/private (new commits) modified: _pages/private (new commits) If the results of regenerating the Hub using the updated submodules look good, you can update the SHA references for the current branch by running: $ git add _data/private _pages/private $ git status On branch master Changes to be committed: (use \"git reset HEAD <file>...\" to unstage) modified: _data/private modified: _pages/private $ git commit -m 'Updated private submodules' $ git push Advanced submodule commands Everything described so far should suffice for Hub development. However, the git submodules section of the online Pro Git book much deeper into the git submodules command and what you can do with it."},{"title":"Hub 101 - Using the `./go` Script","url":"/hub/101/go/","tags":[],"body":"Hub 101 - Using the ./go Script The ./go script sets up the Hub development environment and contains the most common development commands. It was inspired by a pair of blog posts by Pete Hodgson of ThoughtWorks, In Praise of the ./go Script - Part I and In Praise of the ./go Script - Part II. Run ./go in the root directory of the Hub repository for a list of available commands. The test, serve, and serve_public commands are the most common for routine development. While it's expected that the ./go script will change with the times, the basic information here should remain valid regardless. (The one exception to this might be whether or not we eventually pass arguments to individual ./go commands.) Initializing the environment Run the following to install the Bundler gem and all the other gems currently required by the Hub: $ ./go init Required gems are listed in the Gemfile. bundler stores specific versions of these gems in the Gemfile.lock file. See the Bundler Gemfile docs for details on the format of these files. For 18F team members: Run the following to initialize the _data/private and _pages/private submodules: $ git submodule init $ git submodule update See Git Submodules for more details. Serving the Hub locally See Internal vs. Public Hubs for the difference between the \"internal\" and \"public\" versions of the Hub: # To serve the internal Hub at http://localhost:4000/ $ ./go serve # To serve the public Hub at https://localhost:4000/hub/ $ ./go serve_public Running the test suite If you're working on the plugin code (in _plugins), you can run the entire test suite with: $ ./go test Updating Gems Whether you've added a new Gem requirement to the Gemfile or you wish to import new versions of existing gems, you can update the existing Gem set and the Gemfile.lock file by running: $ ./go update_gems Under the Hood Each ./go command corresponds to a function of the same name within the ./go script. None of the commands take arguments currently; you may wish to look inside the ./go script to see the underlying commands and use them directly with different arguments."},{"title":"Hub 101 - Internal vs. Public Hubs","url":"/hub/101/internal-vs-public/","tags":[],"body":"Hub 101 - Internal vs. Public Hubs The Hub has the capability to filter out \"internal\" information to produce a \"public\" version of the Hub. This enables a team to expose as much of its information and structure to the world as possible while still keeping sensitive information visible only within the team. How _data/private works The _data/private directory is a mount point for the 18F data-private repository imported as a git submodule. This repository is private and accessible only to 18F team members. If the submodule is available, its data will be used to generate both the \"internal\" and \"public\" versions of the Hub, by either promoting or deleting data marked as private: within the YAML files. Note: Files in _data corresponding to files in _data/private will be ignored if the _data/private submodule is available. See Git Submodules for more information on how to work with the _data/private submodule. The hash-joiner Gem implements the private: data promotion/removal; follow the \"Documentation\" link on that page for details. How _data works If _data/private is empty, then files from _data will be used to generate both the \"internal\" and \"public\" versions of the Hub. The _data directory is populated with data imported from _data/private using the _data/import-public.rb script. This script generates new data files with all private: information removed. This enables the Hub to be built by other teams who wish to experiment with running their own Hub, using public 18F team data as a starting point. _data/import-public.rb is run automatically by the internal 18F Hub deployment environment with every update to the 18F data-private repository (via GitHub Webooks), ensuring that _data/public remains fresh. How _pages and _pages/private work All documents intended only for the internal Hub should be stored in _pages/private. Documents that can be shared on the public Hub can be stored in _pages. Pages in either directory should contain a permalink: property in their front matter. For example: --- title: About the 18F Hub permalink: /about/ --- Pages in _pages/private should ensure that this permalink: always begins with /private/. For example: --- title: 18F Private Team Documentation --- All _pages/private pages are filtered out by the joiner.rb plugin when generating the public Hub. Sections of pages outside _pages/private that link to documents in _pages/private should be surrounded by the following Liquid conditional: {% unless site.public %} ... {% endunless %} Rationale Partitioning the private team data into a separate private repository, mounted as a git submodule, accomplishes two objectives: Potentially sensitive and personal data that we wish to keep private is firewalled inside a private repository. Team members only have to update their data in a single place, and from there it will propagate to the Hub, to the 18F Home Page, and the 18F Project Dashboard. The private repository/git submodule solution is effective because it: allows the Hub code to be open-sourced in its entirety, without the need for a separately-maintained private fork; ensures there is one authoritative source for both public and private data across projects; and commits to the master data repo trigger GitHub webhooks to launch staging builds of affected projects."},{"title":"Hub 101 - Setting up the Ruby environment with `rbenv`","url":"/hub/101/rbenv/","tags":[],"body":"Hub 101 - Setting up the Ruby environment with rbenv Using rbenv helps ensure a stable Ruby version during development. rbenv is also used to deploy the Hub and 18f.gsa.gov. (rvm is another Ruby version manager preferred by some, but installing rvm instead of rbenv is left as an exercise for the reader.) In the following example, we'll install rbenv under /usr/local/rbenv. Replace ~/.bashrc with the appropriate configuration file for your shell: $ export RBENV_ROOT=/usr/local/rbenv $ sudo mkdir $RBENV_ROOT $ sudo chown $USER $RBENV_ROOT $ git clone https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv.git $RBENV_ROOT $ echo 'export RBENV_ROOT=/usr/local/rbenv' >> ~/.bashrc $ echo 'export PATH=\"$RBENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc $ echo 'eval \"$(rbenv init -)\"' >> ~/.bashrc $ source ~/.bashrc To more easily install and manage Ruby versions using rbenv, we'll also install the ruby-build plugin: $ cd $RBENV_ROOT $ git pull $ git clone https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build.git \\ $RBENV_ROOT/plugins/ruby-build $ rbenv rehash Now we're ready to install the Ruby version of our choice.

During development, running ./go build will generate both the internal and public versions of the Hub, and both versions will be served by the local Nginx instance immediately. For the internal version of the site, the dev server will default to setting the Nginx $authenticated_user variable (used by _layouts/bare.html) to the authenticated_user value in deploy/ansible/playbook.yml.

This page provides an overview of how we work, the tools we use, and the different sites you'll use to do your job. Over the next week, you'll set up your dev environment, learn how to create a blog post, and get connected to all of the sites we use on a regular basis. What is this site? You're looking at a page on The Hub. The Hub is our internal, editable Wiki with information about how 18F works and what tools we use to do our work. The best place to start on The Hub is the New to 18F page, which contains a checklist of administrative things to do during your first week. Like every part of the Hub, the New to 18F page is a working document. If you see something that could be improved, please make a note of it. You’ll learn how to update The Hub later this week. Who is on my team and when will I meet them? On Tuesday, we'll invite you to a meeting where we'll introduce you to the team, our current sprint — or work cycle — and how we work together. During this meeting we'll cover: Who is on the team right now. Elaine and Greg are the 18f-site team's lead and owner. Our team is made up of different people who have the availibility to embed with us for each sprint. We assess who can work with us during each sprint — as well as their specific skills — to assess what we can accomplish during any particular sprint. You can see who is on the team on the Hub on the 18f.gsa.gov team page. Your role on the team Your role on the team will largely depend on your background and skill set. We have tasks available for designers, developers, researchers, content strategists, UX designers, and others. We are always happy to have new members of the team, so if you don't fit one of these roles, let us know and we'll cook up something together. How we work We use Slack and GitHub to communicate and complete our work. We also use Google Hangouts for sprint planning, review, and retrospectives. We'll let you know what Slack channels you should join and how to find your teammates. Who are our stakeholders and what is the review period like? Our team is directly accountable to the rest of the 18F staff. Everyone else who works for 18F is considered a stakeholder. In addition to a sprint review for our team, at the end of every sprint we give the team opportunities to review our work and give us feedback. Tools We Use Below are links to the tools and resources our team has for different tasks.

We work in the open and share information that makes our work understandable and usable. We write frankly about the challenges we encounter and detail the lessons we learn when making tough decisions. Our blog sheds light on the innovation, integrity, and creativity of our teams and other teams across the government. We hope to lead by example, showing that government agencies can be straightforward and friendly in their communication. Additionally, our blog is a platform for highlighting the diversity and humanity of our team. We are a thoughtful, civic-minded group, and we acknowledge the value of underscoring that to our readers. Both our business and recruitment benefit when we post personal stories and profiles, which engender warmth and connection between 18F and the larger community. In sum, our goals are: * To support and highlight the operational excellence our employees’ daily work provides to GSA, the federal government, and the public * To strengthen our partnership with other federal agencies * To strengthen our relationship with the public and people who might want to join 18F * To actively promote innovation in government, wherever it’s happening Execution Our publications adhere to 18F’s Content Guide, actively promoting both a unified style and a multitude of voices. The communications team determines editorial strategy; that team also oversees the drafting and editing process. The blog is further supported by volunteer writers across 18F. Team contributions (idea generation, drafting, giving interviews) are key to its success. We accept pitches for blog ideas from everyone on the 18F team in a working GitHub repository. We also cover events that involve team members. Risks and concerns We assess every post to ensure it adheres to our mission, as outlined above. This might mean a blog post aligns with GSA’s vision and goals. It might also mean a post is one of human-interest. Being this open about all aspects of our work is atypical for a government agency, and, as such, we expect to encounter occasional resistance. We acknowledge the need to show strategy and data that supports our ambition. Conclusion Part of GSA’s mission is to “deliver the best value in… technology services to government and the American people.” By showcasing the value 18F provides to users, this blog is a vital part of GSA’s communications platforms."},{"title":"How to write a blog for 18F","url":"/hub/blogging/","tags":[],"body":"How to write a blog for 18F At 18F we keep a private GitHub repo for kicking around ideas on the blog.

We also use sprints to introduce new features in a short period of time. A doc sprint is yet another way we can collectively rally within a scheduled period of time to get things done. A doc sprint is slightly different than what some of us normally think of as a sprint: A doc sprint is more event-focused than a sprint. The goal of a doc sprint is broader: to get something to the next plateau rather than to implement specific feature sets. How Does a Doc Sprint Work? Someone identifies a process that could benefit from a concentrated effort (for example, on-boarding) and decides to organizer a doc sprint. The doc sprint organizers compile a list of to-dos and assemble them in one place. These could be: GitHub issues Trello tasks Surveys At the appointed time, doc sprint participants collectively attack the to-do list, with individuals submitting a record of what they did. It's the organizers' job to make that last part easy. After the appointed time, there will be thanks and recognition. The organizers report on doc sprint outcomes and tweak the process for next time. Why? The goal of a doc sprint isn't to clutter calendars that are already full. A doc sprint should: promote collaboration and ownership of 18F culture create a model for future 18F doc sprints provide a safe space for people to learn 18F tools Who Should Doc Sprint? Everyone at 18F can (and should!) contribute to a doc sprint. No special ops, code, or design skills necessary.

Making sure 18F's documentation is accessible and comprehensive is critical for scaling what we do. Documentation includes, but is not limited to: READMEs, especially making sure that anyone can easily build/run a project in minutes (if not seconds) Onboarding guides a la the 18F-site team onboarding guide Updating our 18F Guides Here are some helpful materials and resources for participating in a doc sprint. Event Specific To-Do Lists Specific information and to-do list for each doc sprint: April 17 Onboarding Doc Sprint For All Doc Sprints You Will Need To participate in an 18F doc sprint, you will need: A GitHub account with two-factor authentication enabled. (Insert link to GitHub section below) Ways to Contribute Each doc sprint will have a specific to-do list. You can participate by: Creating or updating documentation on the to-do list. Suggesting new documentation. The method for making a suggestion will depend on the project, but might be a GitHub issue or a Trello task. Giving feedback about documentation that others are creating during the doc sprint. This kind of conversation usually happens in a GitHub issue. Testing documentation created by others. For example, trying to stand up a local version of a project by following the directions in its README file. Tools Markdown Most 18F documentation is written in Markdown, a language that converts text to HTML. The syntax for Markdown is listed here. You can find a cheatsheet here. You can also use a program like Dillinger which shows you how the Markdown will look as you type it. If you're more comfortable writing in a Google Doc, you can later convert a .docx file using Pandoc on the command line with the following command: pandoc -f docx -t markdown ~/path/to/file.docx -o ~/Desktop/post.md For documentation hosted on GitHub, note that GitHub-flavored markdown is in effect. It's very similar to regular Markdown but has some slight differences as well as some extra features like syntax highlighting. Git and GitHub A large amount of 18F documentation is managed via git repositories. These are hosted on GitHub, which makes it easy to track version of documents, track issues, and make changes, which are called pull requests. If you're not familiar with Git and GitHub, these resources can get you started. You definitely don't need to be a git power user, and you can always ask questions in the #git #questions or #wg-documentation Slack channel(s). We recommend starting with this extensive guide we wrote for working with GitHub and the terminal. The first step in the guide details how to set up your computer to work on 18F projects. Please complete this step, which will install the necessary software you need to work at 18F, regardless of which project you plan to tackle during the sprint. (If you're new to GitHub, feel free to work through the rest of the steps, which acclimate you to both GitHub and the terminal.) * GitHub also maintains a very good help section on mastering GitHub basics, mastering Issues, and a guide to the various commands you'll use on the Command line. * If you do not want to use the command line, that's okay too. You can download GitHub for Mac, which is a program that allows you to work within GitHub without using the command line. GitHub provides a very good tutorial for GitHub for Mac here. * If you're working in The Hub, we've written up a guide for how to edit GitHub documents online using prose.io, which is similar to GitHub for Mac in that you do not need to use the command line.

Do these things to prepare for them: Every project: update project READMEs. Create an onboarding guide for your team. (You can use the 18F website team's as a model.) Update our 18F Guides. This cohort will test our documentation as they onboard. April 17th: we sprint and improve our onboarding docs to prepare for the next cohort. Why? The theme for 18F's first official doc sprint is onboarding. The Onboarding+Doc Sprint will culminate on April 17th, 2015. The ops and onboarding teams are doing tremendous work to make sure new hires have the best possible transition to life at 18F. There's additional work to do, however, and a key component involves making sure our individual teams and working groups are ready to absorb the upcoming influx of new hires. Also, as the Hub becomes integral to onboarding, we need to make sure the information there is correct and useful. The onboarding process is more than documentation, but documentation is critical to making sure onboarding can scale. The Plan A large cohort is starting at 18F on April 6th, and these new teammates are the incentive for the onboarding doc sprint. Here's an outline of our thinking. Before April 6th Project teams and working groups get their onboarding houses in order. At a minimum, the documentation for each project should contain the following information: In Project Repository Make sure README.md has: A link to an existing public instance of the project. Links to internal/staging versions can be listed on the Hub (see below) if you don't want them publicly visible. Description of the workflow for submitting project code changes (e.g. do you fork or branch?) How to stand up a development version of the project. Installation commands, scripts, a Vagrantfile for forced fresh install, etc. Project management-related information: Links to GitHub issues, sprint plans, dashboards, etc. Links to task management tools (GitHub, Trello, Pivotal Tracker) Quick write-up of where things are: GitHub issues versus sprint plans Also consider: Updating the CONTRIBUTING file to reflect the workflow as written in README.md. Tagging issues as new-to-project. On the Hub Make sure your project has a Hub page and that it contains the following information: Daily standup time and location Sprint plan days/time/location Point of contact for project's calendar invites Links to internal/staging versions of the project, if applicable April 6th - April 16th Our new coworkers onboard using the materials we've created. We all use this opportunity to record opportunities for improvement. The specific feedback mechanisms will likely be project-specific (e.g., GitHub issue, Trello card). In addition, doc sprint organizers will survey the new cohort to get additional ideas. Doc Sprint Day: April 17th Here's a list of things you can work on during the April 17th doc sprint. Hub issues 18F Guide issues After you complete a task, please log it using our doc sprint form so we can report on what got done. Post-Doc Sprint The doc sprint organizers will survey participants, sift through the collected metrics, and report back: How many people participated? What did the doc sprint help accomplish for individuals, projects, working groups, and guilds? How many issues did we fix? What is now possible after the doc sprint that wasn't possible before? What should we do differently in the next doc sprint?"},{"title":"Google Calendar pro tips","url":"/hub/google-calendar-tips/","tags":[],"body":"Working hours About a third of the way down the \"General\" settings page there's a section called \"Working hours\" and a checkbox (bizarrely) unchecked by default. If you check it, you can specify the days and times that are your preferred working hours. Once you save your changes, other people will get a warning if they try and schedule you outside those times. Super awesome bonus setting! A related feature in the Labs page is called \"Hide morning and night\" which will \"minimize a range of hours in the morning and at night. Another super awesome bonus setting! Another handy lab: Automatically declining events, will give you the option of \"Busy (decline invitations)\" in addition to \"Available\" and \"Busy\" under the \"Show me as\" section when creating events. Event duration By default, Google Calendar thinks you want to schedule 30 minute meetings with people. But some people can't sit still very long and prefer shorter meetings. Other people really like talking and prefer longer meetings. (Just kidding, Russ.) If you are either of those people, this is the setting for you: On the \"General\" settings screen look for a section called \"Default event duration\" and click the dropdown to choose from either 15, 30, 60, 90, or (:scream:) 120 minutes. Super awesome bonus setting! See that checkbox right below the dropdown? The one that says \"Speedy meetings?\" Check that box and 30 minutes becomes 25, 60 becomes 50, 90 becomes 80, and 120 becomes 110. Time zones You can add an additional time zone. Helpful if you regularly have to schedule meetings with people who live on the other side of the country. It's limited to one, though, so if you have a multi-time zoned team it's only so helpful. In the \"Your current time zone:\" section, click the \"Show an additional time zone\" link. Super awesome bonus setting! There's a \"world clock\" feature under \"labs\" which doesn't integrate as well with the calendar but does show the current time in multiple timezones. Adding video calls When you create an event, under the \"Where\" input there's a link for \"Add video call.\" Click this to add a Google Hangout to the meeting. Helpful if you don't expect your colleagues across the country to come to DC for your meeting! Super awesome bonus setting! The \"Add video call\" link automatically gives the call a name like gregory-boone. But that's a dumb name for a video call. Click the \"change name\" link below the new \"Join meeting\" link and you can set it to whatever you want! Find a time!

We are so glad you are here. Help make onboarding better Before you begin, it’s worth pointing out that this page contains a ton of links to get you set up. Furthermore, we realize this might not be the easiest thing to do on your own. We’re working on it. In the meantime, if you could please keep track of what is missing and/or confusing, and let us know in #wg-onboarding channel (or “chat room”) on Slack (our internal chat client), we promise to make things better! Who’s “we,” you might ask? Well, everyone in #wg-onboarding—but specifically @melodykramer and @andrewmaier as they’ve been tasked with making onboarding better. So if you've got a very specific question or pointed feedback, be sure to message them directly or mention them by name in the #wg-onboarding channel. This will make life easier for the next person being onboarded. Thanks! Do these things immediately! Please read the 18F code of conduct. Work remotely? Start here. If you don't work in DC, please make sure you start here for tips from other 18F employees. Set up two-factor authentication for email, Github, and Slack. Set up Slack. You'll have questions about the steps below, and you'll need to ask for help. (Hint: There's as #questions channel.) Get GitHub configured properly for work. Even if you aren't a developer, many discussions happen on GitHub, and it's required to add or update Hub pages. Secure your MacBook. Get familiar with Google Drive and the 18F Team folder The folder structure may be unintutive; make sure to bookmark folders you want to browse regularly, otherwise use search instead. Searching in Drive goes through all the files that have been shared with you. Highlight a file, then hit Shift-Z to quickly add files or folders to \"My Drive\" for fast access. Grant \"edit\" or \"comment\" access to the entire team on a files by adding 18f-team@gsa.gov in the Share menu. Consider disabling the notification email if you don’t wish to bring it to the team’s attention right away. You can also create and share whole folders; new files in a folder auto-inherit the sharing settings. Run the laptop script to configure your 18F laptop with everything you need to be productive. Read Greg and Mel's blog post on how to use GitHub, which will walk you through the script. Get your badge. Set up VPN and remote network access. [this may be failing currently on Macs] Make a calendar reminder to badger for access to On-line University (OLU), GSA's mandatory training courses. You won't have access until you are set up in CHRIS, but once you have access, training is mandatory or you lose computer privileges. Instructions for the training are here. If you are in the SF office, change the order of your wireless networks so that gsa-wireless is higher priority than GSA-Guest (otherwise you will be shunted to the latter silently and lose time troubleshooting as a result). Check out the team-specific onboarding pages ...if they apply to you. 18F Site Next, check on these items in a more relaxed manner during your first two weeks Add yourself to our contact info, Hub, and homepage. Do these steps to get onto the 18F Team page. Read the 18F open source policy (especially if you're not a developer!) and the team process FAQ.. Learn about weekly time reporting, which occurs every Monday. Here are some hardware and software tips from your coworkers. Get a conference line from GSA if you might ever need a phone line for client calls. Configure Bookit, our room reservation system, to save yourself time in the future. Make sure your work phone is on its way. Sync work info to an iOS device. Connect with 18F on social media (if you're into that). Get business cards. After getting OLU access, get set-up to travel with GSA. Review the Office of Government Ethics Social Media Standards. Explore employee discounts, including about 15% on cellphone plans. Email and listservs Add a password to your GSA email listserv preferences (or change your subscriptions). Subscribe to some listservs. Tools Learn about our collaboration tools. Read some Slack tips. Check out our GitHub tips. Get access to Google Analytics by posting in Slack channel #analytics. As a backup, ping @Gray on Slack. Learn more about Trello. Learn about mural.ly, too.

Even if you don't consider yourself a developer, we want you to have access to (and eventually be comfortable with) GitHub. The setup is a handful of steps, but we promise it isn't scary. Steps to get set up Create an account. If you're signing up for a new account, use your work email to assist with records retention. If you already have a GitHub account, simply add your work email. Add your name and a profile picture to your account. This makes it a lot easier for your teammates to know whose account it is and to administer the teams, but most of all it helps a lot with autocomplete in a bunch of situations. We are not dogmatic that the avatar be a headshot, but please make it unique. Enable two-factor authentication. GitHub access will not be provided if two-factor authentication is turned off. While you're at it, it's a very, very good idea to do this for your Gmail account and elsewhere. Drop into #admins-github on Slack and ask to be added to the @18F/18F team on GitHub, saying that you followed the steps above. After of of the admins says you've been added, accept the \"invite\" here. Go to the organization's people page, click where it says \"private\" next to your name, and change it to \"public.\" Get Github configured properly for work This is only relevant if using the command-line. Use your work email rather than your personal email for work-related commits – instructions at https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git. Note that this is different than setting notifications to go to one or another email address. If you’re using your work computer for personal projects on GitHub and want your personal email tied to those commits, you can set your GSA email as part of the global .gitconfig, then override on a repository level with your personal email, or use a tool like karn. If you have both emails in your GitHub settings, though, they will both be tied to your GitHub account anyway. Also, make sure you have notifications turned on. Go to this page and make sure your notifications are set up they way you'd like them. (Some people watch every repo; some only watch when they're mentioned.) Teams After the steps above, you should be a member of the 18F GitHub organization. This will ensure you access into private repos that are team wide — DevOps, edit access to these pages, etc. — and repos where general write access is encouraged. Even if you don't have write access into a repo, we strongly encourage the submission of pull requests for improvements or fixes. If you can't access any 18F GitHub repositories: Ensure you have two-factor authentication enabled (as explained above) and then ask someone in the #admins-github Slack channel to add you to the 18F GitHub organization. Contractors or external collaborators should only be added to teams with scoped write permissions to the repos they're working on. They should never have admin level rights. In order to seperate these permissions, create a team in the format of projectname-admins for staff. Please coordinate with DevOps in the Slack channel when onboarding contractors or external collaborators. Learn more After you feel comfortable with Git and GitHub, be sure to read and complete all of our GitHub Standards. @wslack created a GitHub Basics guide and training, which teaches you the pointy-clicky GitHub for Mac interface. @melody and @gboone wrote a great tutorial on how to use GitHub on the command-line.

API - Application programming interface. Think of them as a way for computers to interact, either internally or between one another. If you wanted to make a website that shows the current temperature wherever you are, your code talks to one API to get your location, then another to find out the weather in that area. ATO - Authority to Operate. It's a sign-off from an authorized agency official for a website to be allowed to engage with citizens, including security and some other stuff. Historically this is a three to six month process, but 18F has been working to fix this. Noah Kunin can sometimes help speed the process. AWS - Amazon Web Services. When we make websites, this is where they all live. AWS - Alternative Work Schedule. Working eight, 10-hour days or working nine, nine-hour days in a pay period. Back end developer - The people who write the code for the parts of a web site you don't see, working in programming languages like Ruby, Python, or NodeJS. They work on pieces of the application that, for example: Generate shopping recommendations Gather all of the information for search to work Trigger emails being sent CHRIS – GSA’s Comprehensive Human Resources Integrated System is an e-Tool that enables employees to access their personnel files online.

Full stack developer - Someone who does both front end and back end development. GCIMS – GSA Credential and Identity Management System, a GSA internal web database that provides authoritative information on GSA personnel, work locations and credentials. GCIMS also stores your contact information, so you may need to update that from time to time. Instructions for adding a phone number are here. GDS - the UK's Government Digital Services are government pioneers and fellow technologists across the pond. GitHub - A website to help people collaborate to build software.

Fortunately, many great features are available that you might not be aware of. Here’s a quick overview: Gmail Since you can't set a profile picture in Google profile (Google+), you just need to do it in Gmail settings. Groups You can't create your own groups directly; you have to request them. You can't access public google groups via the Google Groups website, but group owners can directly add your address to send and receive public group emails. People outside GSA can't access GSA google groups via the Google Groups website, but email still works - note the permissions for the Google group though. Calendar You can't share calendars with anyone outside GSA. You can share individual invites, just not whole calendars. Docs You can't share docs with the public, only GSA or specific users, even just to view. You can't publish docs to the web. Docs that contain sensitive information will be blocked from sharing via Cloudlock (as of August 22, 2014). Drive It appears that offline syncing for Google Drive/Docs has been disabled for GSA. This is consistent with the GSA firewall entirely blocking access to Dropbox. Google Hangouts and Google Voice Google Hangouts and Google Voice mostly work, but Google+ has been disabled, which impacts these services to some extent. Note that Google is in the process of merging Google Voice into Google Hangouts. You can make and receive free domestic phone calls from within Gmail or Google Hangouts. Just create a new number with your GSA account at google.com/voice You can also use Google Hangouts to do conference calling, video conferences, screensharing, and bridge to a telephone line (free domestically). You can create Hangouts rooms from Google Calendar or by just adding them to a URL, for example, https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/gsa.gov/roomname. You can’t do Google Hangouts On Air with your GSA account since On Air currently requires Google+ which is disabled for GSA. Google+ Google+ is disabled, but many features — including Google Hangouts — are now decoupled from Google+ and are generally accessible.

In other cases, if the collaborators are scoped to a particular project, you can name the team something like PROJECT NAME - COLLABORATORS|SKILL SET. In the \"Description\" of the team, put something reasonable plus a point of contact email address for the collaborators, if relevant. Ideally this is the address of someone senior, someone we could email if issues come up, someone who can rally the troops.

This describes the flow of the comms review and the policies involved. 1. New snippets announced internally The weekly snippets batch will be committed to 18F/data-private/snippets/v3 in CSV format, using a filename in the format YYYYMMDD.csv. The published snippets, both internal and public, will be announced on 18f-team. 2. New comms review ticket opened Mike Bland will open a comms review ticket in the data-private GitHub repo, set it to the comms-ready milestone, and assign it to Ori Hoffer. The ticket will contain the link to the new snippets, e.g. https://hub.18f.us/hub/snippets/20141208. 3. Comms review initiated Ori will review the snippets for the following types of material that should be redacted/edited: Language/Style: Reporters, industry watchdogs, congressional staffers could be reading these, so comments will be edited for clarity. Announcements of new projects: Snippets is not the place to make news; let’s save that for the blog, which already has its own comms review process. Internal arguments/debates: Sharing our decision-making process only opens us up to second-guessing from the outside. 4. Redactions/edits committed Ori will add any necessary {{ and }} redaction tokens and make any necessary edits to the CSV file via GitHub's web interface. Until GitHub webhooks are implemented, Mike will regenerate the updated public snippets and confirm with Ori that the updates appear as intended. 5.

Feel free to participate or not as you desire. If you've nothing of interest to report, then skip posting this week! Be professional Snippets aren't the place to vent frustration. Concrete, objective information will prove the most helpful to yourself and everyone else who might peruse your snippets. Don't read every snippet You are not compelled to read every person's every snippet every week. Nothing's stopping you, but there are no gold stars for reading them all. The first audience is the author The author of a snippet is free to write as much or as little as he or she finds helpful to track his or her own progress. It's largely a personal practice that, coincidentally, may prove helpful or informative for others. Brevity is the soul of wit That said, strive for conciseness. It does make it easier for others to peruse your snippets, which can lead to fruitful, serendipitous discussions and insights. Private by default Currently snippets are visible only to other 18F team members. However, support for publicly-visible snippets is underway. If you want any of your snippets to be visible outside of 18F, click the Public box on the form. Redact specific information If most of your snippets are OK for public consumption, and you've selected the Public box on the form, yet there are details you'd like to omit, you can redact spans of text by surrounding them with {{ and }} tokens. Last week and this week The Last Week and This Week sections encourage separation between past and future items. However, if you want to put everything into the Last Week section, you are free to do so. Plaintext or Markdown Markdown syntax is supported but not required; plaintext will always work.

AWS hosts not just our production systems, but everything else too: development, staging, testing, etc. If you're used to developing locally, you should feel empowered to do everything in AWS if you'd like. Note that AWS is currently the only approved IaaS provider. You're free to develop purely locally as long as you'd like, but if you want to get something online, AWS is the only option. Even if you are familiar with IaaS providers in general, or AWS specifically, before you are given access you must go through on-boarding with the 18F DevOps team. Sometime in 2015, this on-boarding will be part of 18F On-boarding for all relevant staff. If you're reading this now, need access, and haven't gone through the training, jump into the #devops channel in Slack to arrange for a session. Fundamentals If you are familiar with running virtual machines on your own computer, through Parallels, Virtualbox, or VMWare, AWS operates on the same principles but on a truly massive scale. Pretty much everything in AWS can be orchestrated via the AWS API & command-line interface. Log-in We don't use the standard AWS log in site. You will need to go to https://18f.signin.aws.amazon.com/console to log in. Your username will be created for you during onboarding. Check the MFA Token box on the login form, and enter your information from Google Authenticator, Authy, or another OTP app. Servers The core service of AWS is the Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). These are virtual machines just like on your computer, but hosted in the AWS environment. You receive access through a GUI, the AWS Management Console, an API, and to the guest OS through SSH. Network security At 18F, we require all EC2 instances to be launched into a virtual private cloud (VPC). Your network security settings are set at the VPC level: on what ports, from what IP addresses, can EC2 instances communicate with each other and back out to the internet. Occasionally, out-of-date documentation from third parties and Amazon itself may reference EC2 Classic. We at 18F do not support this environment. Object storage If you want very basic and cheap object storage, AWS provides the Simple Storage Service (S3). Permissions AWS Identity and Access Management IAM is where all permissions are set, both for human users and EC2 instances themselves if they need to communicate commands to other AWS services. Currently, modifications to anything under IAM must go through 18F DevOps. These are just the concepts necessary for initial on-boarding. AWS has an extensive list of other services. Constraints There are a few special notes on using any IaaS in the Federal context. Other people's money The Federal Government cannot pay one penny more than it is authorized to spend. There is no retroactive justification for spends. When Government exceeds these limits, a report report and explanation is required to the GSA Administrator, General Counsel, and Congress. So tracking costs is a big deal. Every inter-agency agreement (IAA) at 18F needs to have a line item on a total value to spend on infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services (AWS). Unless it is part of a negotiation with 18F DevOps, we do not pay for non-production hosting costs. All costs must go back to the Federal partner or another funding source. There is no actual concept of non-billable - there are only costs that are directly or indirectly billable. If we don't bill a funding source, it means that 18F's rates must go up that next fiscal year in order indirectly recoup costs. For AWS, the cost of almost every service can be tracked through the usage of tags. Tags are just simple key:value pieces of metadata. Unfortunately, there does not seem to be any canonical list of which AWS services supports tags, nor is there any consistent way within the AWS Management Console of each particular service to apply or change a tag. Once you gain access to the AWS Management Console, you can click on various resources and see if a Tags tab or link is available. In this example, the 18F Hub site has two tags: AWS has recently deployed significant improvements for tag management. There is now a global viewer and editor for all tags. The most important resources to tag are EC2 instances and RDS instances. You should also consult the AWS documentation of the service you're using. Format for the client tag 18F DevOps maintains a list of canonical unique identitifers (UIDs) to use for all the client tags of a project. The UID is formed from an acronym of the Federal partner, the start date of the IAA, the end date of the IAA, and a number that increments with each subsequent IAA. While we might be able to have teams self-provision the UID in the future, for now, please only use the UIDs on the list. If you see your project missing, please contact the Director of Delivery Architecture in Slack. Note that both the key and the value of AWS tags are case-sensitive. Keep keys and values as all lower-case, except when using an acronym. Other people's information Any system in AWS might have the public's information (as opposed to public data) at any time. Some systems, like MyUSA, use row-level encryption to help protect that information. Depending on the data being stored, others may not, and you may have access to the underlying data in order to do your job. In order to make sure we are protecting the privacy and integrity of the public's data, you have no expectation of privacy on these systems. Everything you do on these systems is subject to monitoring and auditing. Use common sense when handling this information. Unless you have permission and need to in order to do your job: Don't release information Don't share information Don't view information Regardless of your own norms around privacy, always assume the owner of that data has the most conservative requirements unless they have taken express action, either through a communication or the system itself, telling you otherwise. We also take particular care in protecting sensitive personally identifiable information (PII). PII is any information that can be linked back to an individual. For example, this includes a person's full name, their home address, and their phone number. Sensitive PII is information which if lost, compromised, or disclosed without authorization, could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to an individual. While this is inherently a subjective definition, there are certain types of information we always treat as Sensitive PII: Driver's license or state identification number Social security number (SSN) Financial account number(s) Alien Registration Number Passport number Biometric identifiers Because we live in an increasingly connected world, sometimes sensitive PII can be created by pairing different types of PII. These types of PII become sensitive if paired: Citizenship or immigration status Ethnic or religious affiliation Mother's maiden number Last 4 digits of SSN Medical information Sexual orientation Account passwords Criminal history Date of birth Sensitive PII cannot be on a system unless it has received an Authority to Operate [xlink here]. If you are uncertain if the information you want to work with is Sensitive PII in your context, speak with 18F DevOps beforehand. Security Once you gain access to AWS, you will find yourself responsible for some serious stuff. Environmental variables These are things like your AWS password, secret API key, and the mobile device that generates your multi-factor authentication token. You are wholly and solely responsible for safeguarding them, and are responsible if they are released to non-authorized parties. If you are unfamiliar with how to protect these variables, please consult with 18F DevOps. We're working on getting additional tools to help make this easy for everyone. OS baseline We use a pre-hardened version of Ubuntu as our baseline OS for all EC2 instances in AWS. In AWS, there are Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) in each AWS Region that these controls already implemented. You should always launch new instances from this baseline. HTTPS Everywhere Regardless of what your system does, we enforce HTTPS Everywhere. Demo agenda All Services Tags for Name and client must be set if available. VPCs Create a VPC with both private and public subnets Create a security group EC2 Generate a new keypair with naming convention. Launch a basic EC2 instance into the VPC, with the security group set Remind that all connections must be set only for what is necessary. Explain the function of the 0.0.0.0/0 block - only applies to inbound/outbound to the internet on port 80/443 for HTTP/HTTPS. Everything else should be expressly set. If keypairs must be shared, only authorized way to share them is through GSA Google Drive (create a folder, share it with your coworker, delete the file once they have it) Setup and successfully SSH in Generate an ssh key for further use & install in authorized_keys CloudWatch Review basic CloudWatch monitoring Setting a CloudWatch alarm for a metric Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) and Elastic IPs (EIPs) Explain ELB concept Create an additional EC2 instance Create an ELB Associate them with the ELB Note that IPs of EC2 instances may change with stop and restart. ELBs have fully qualified domain names (FQDN ) that do not change. Other alternative when necessary: Elastic IPs. Precious resource. HTTPS Everywhere Review settings for ELBs and Nginx Create IAM users First name + Last Name in camel case.

This living document is the 18F team standards and practices for our use of Slack. Any change to this standard, or any global technical change to our Slack account, will be announced via an @channel in #news (the default channel to which all users are subscribed and unable to leave). Summary Everything in this standard is required, unless explicitly stated otherwise. TL;DR: Complete your profile Adhere to our Code of Conduct, i.e. treat everyone with respect Treat Slack as a public forum, i.e. assume you have no privacy Use two-factor authentication Complete your profile Because we are a distributed team, Slack is often the first way we \"meet\" each other. Please fully complete your profile so people have a better chance of knowing who you are. This includes first name, last name, a unique profile picture (photos are preferred, but not required), phone number, and a summary of what you do, what teams you're on, and where you're located. Code of Conduct Just like an in-person meeting or event, conduct on Slack is governed by the all relevant laws and GSA policies, in addition to the 18F Code of Conduct. Please read our Code of Conduct carefully. Bottom line: Don't say something on Slack that you wouldn't feel comfortable saying to someone's face. Note that sarcasm is hard to communicate online - sincerity is usually easier to understand. If you see anyone violating our Code of Conduct, please report it immediately in #admins-slack. If you don't feel comfortable reporting it there, you can send a direct message to either Noah Kunin [@noah] or Hillary Hartley [@hillary]. Who can use Slack? Slack is required for all 18F staff. We can also invite people outside 18F to have access to a single channel on our Slack account. These single-channel users are free, and don't need financial authorization from TeamOps or security clearance from DevOps. These users may include: vendors under contract (not just a Terms of Service) with 18F partners at federal agencies whose projects are under an Interagency Agreement with 18F federal staff with government email addresses (for example, friends at the USDS, CFPB, other teams inside GSA, etc.) members of the public collaborating on an open source project in a public channel via chat.18f.gov Project stakeholders Projects are free to invite their government partners to specific channels to foster collaboration and asynchronous communication with the team. Several projects have set up specific channels for this communication that end with -partners. Our partners may be invited as single-channel guests at no cost to the project or agency. If you would like for your partners to have access to more than one channel, this expense will need to be part of the IAA and cleared by TeamOps and DevOps. Friends Friends from other government teams can be invited into a project's channel or a general purpose channel like #friends. If the individual is a federal employee, and the main purpose of inviting them is to work on government projects, the invite should be sent to their .gov email address. Teammates from the United States Digital Service (USDS) One of our biggest collaborators is the USDS. You may see channels that end with -usds — members of the USDS across government are in these channels. In order to keep the signal to noise ratio high, please keep discussion focused on the project or task at hand in each channel. The public Projects that desire chat-like engagement with the public may create public channels. These channels end with -public to signify a channel the public can join. Treat these channels like you would a town hall or other type of public meeting. Members of the public must also comply with GSA standards and the 18F Code of Conduct. To invite people to a public Slack channel, send them to chat.18f.gov and have them select the appropriate channel from the drop-down. Records policy Per the mandatory General Records Schedule 3.1 issued by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), basically everything in Slack channels and groups is considered at minimum a temporary record. To ensure compliance with the possibility that we might create permanent or long-lived records in Slack, the records retention policy is set to retain all messages forever AND also retain edit and deletion logs for all messages. Users are prohibited from deleting messages. Do not abuse the edit command in Slack to effectively delete your message by replacing it with null or symbolic content. Edits for clarity or typos are fine. If Hubot or Giphy ever posts something inappropriate, please call for a clean-up in admins-slack. This policy applies to all types of Slack communications: public channels, private groups, even direct messages. Nothing is private. Security Two-factor authentication Starting on September 1st, 2015, two-factor authentication (2FA) is required to use Slack. If you don't have it enabled, your account will be deactivated. Activating 2FA is really easy. In general, you should have 2FA enabled wherever possible. Infrastructure security Slack is currently built on Amazon Web Services (AWS), which from a federal security perspective, already has a host of protections verified through GSA's FedRAMP program. However, there are currently no assurances that Slack employees can't read any and all of the messages sent via Slack. In fact, Slack makes it clear that its employees do have this ability, and just don't use it without customer permission: All of our employees are bound to our policies regarding customer data and we treat these issues as matters of the highest importance within our company. If, in order to diagnose a problem you are having with the service, we would need to do something which would expose your data to one of our employees in a readable form, we will always ask you prior to taking action and will not proceed without your permission. Our platform will automatically generate an audit entry of any such access. This is the case with most software as a service offerings. We're working with Slack to better map out the process where those permissions are granted. Regardless, we currently do not, and may never, authorize Slack to handle sensitive team or project data. Conclusion Don't say anything on Slack you would feel uncomfortable being attributed to you in public. Treating Slack as if it was a public IRC server is a great best practice. Everything you say is one screen shot away from going public. Don't post anything to Slack that would make our systems vulnerable if it fell into the wrong hands. If you need to share sensitive data (environmental variables, passwords, etc) use Fugacious, an awesome tool built by our very own @jgrevich, to create a short message that is auto-deleted. If you have something that is very complex, please share it using a GSA Google Drive folder, and then promptly delete it once you're done sharing. Treat everyone with respect and get to know the 18F Code of Conduct. The same rules of the road apply to Slack that you would use in person, in a meeting, or at an event."},{"title":"GitHub standards","url":"/hub/standards/github/","tags":[],"body":"GitHub standards Git and GitHub are the standard tools for revision control at 18F.

Security We require all new members to follow security standards which include using two-factor authentication (2FA) and completing a GitHub user profile prior to joining the organization. Credentials / Private Configuration Data: Do not store sensitive information in Git and GitHub Do not store sensitive information in Git, GitHub, or any other revision control system. This includes sensitive environmental variables and other private configuration data. In the event that such information is pushed to a GitHub repository accidentally, and exposed even momentarily, consider it compromised. Revoke or change the credentials immediately. If sensitive information about the public was released, contact DevOps. If you're unsure how to protect this information consult with DevOps on GitHub or in the #admins-github channel in Slack. Some projects use Citadel to store secrets. GitHub integrations: Ask DevOps first and prefer services which request granular permissions Many websites offer the option to \"Sign in with GitHub\". Integrations may ask for \"personal user data\" which may include your public or private email address, all the way up to accessing 18F's private repositories. For this reason, we ask that all organization members refrain from authorizing integrations and request any desired integrations through a DevOps issue. Repositories: Ask before creating private repositories Do not delete repositories Use descriptive names which include the project name For general guidance around contributions, licensing, and the practice of working in public at 18F, please refer to our open source policy.

Before reading the rest of this policy, you must read the readme file at FISMA Ready, a community project co-managed by 18F. You should also take a quick glance at the components that are already FISMA Ready. Compliance Hopefully, at this point you're not too burned out on bureacracy! What all of that boils down is we need to always document our security procedures and then be sure to follow them by creating appropriate controls. Documentation There are three tracks of documentation available: Limited Authority to Operate (LATO) for 90 Days Limited Authority to Operate (LATO) for 1 Year Continuous Authority to Operate (cATO) forever [work in progress, coming in 2015] Pre-authorization You may operate without authorization under the following conditions. The system is deployed to the 18F AWS East/West environment. The system is only available to: staff of the General Services Administration other Federal staff / agencies (either by IP CIDR block or some kind of auth mechanism, HTTP Basic Auth, Oauth (MyUSA), etc) The system does not: interact with or change the state of any production Federal information system, whether it is operated by 18F or our Federal partners. collect or store any sensitive PII. 90 Day authorization Once you're ready to move beyond the restrictions of pre-authorization, you must go through the process to obtained a LATO for 90 Days. This authorization can cover any system in the Discovery, Alpha, or Beta phases. You must have a 90 day authorization before violating any of the restrictions in the section above. The authorization is rolling, and can be renewed for an additional 90 days as long as you require additional testing. This essentially functions as our Authority to Test. You do not have to wait for the 90 days to complete before moving to a new authorization. Getting ready to test The system's technical stack needs to be relatively stable before authorization. This includes a complete list of: AWS services required base code language(s) used and their frameworks third-party services, regardless of level of integration all top-level URLS (ex: staging.18f.us and 18f.gsa.gov) If during testing the system performs: user authentication or authorization back-end administrative functions encryption ...then those features cannot be \"relatively simple\" but must in fact be complete before an authorization will be given. Note that the use of common web frameworks and 18F TLS standards resolves these issues in almost every case. Lastly, make sure the README file in your repo is fully up to date and clearly explains what the system does and why at a high level. You should also include the above information in your README. Writing the system security plan Once you are ready, 18F DevOps and GSA InfoSec will write the System Security Plan, which will detail the above and guide the next phase of work: greybox testing. For greybox testing, the independent testing team has significant (but not necessarily complete) knowledge of how the system works, as opposed to black box testing, where they have zero knowledge or white box testing, where they have complete knowledge. Greybox testing Once you are ready, 18F DevOps and GSA InfoSec will start both automated and manual scanning and testing. This includes: using SSH to go into your EC2 servers to run tests on the operating system checking for web vulnerability scanning on the front-end static code analysis on the master branch of your repo white hat hackers attempting to penetrate the system All of these tests must be conducted on all environments and stacks, including one identical to production. We call this environment and stack \"pre-production\" and will also affix the designation \"scanee\" so there is no ambiguity as to what is being scanned. This also requires a stable master branch. You can continue working on feature branches and deploy those to a development environment. Resolving vulnerabilities If any of the testing or scanning reveals vulnerabilities that we categorize as Critical or High findings, they must be fixed, and the scans re-run, before the system receives a 90 day authorization. Signing an authorization Once the entire process is complete, GSA InfoSec will make a recommendation to the head of the GSA Office of Citizen Services and Innovative Technologies (OCSIT), our current Authorizing Official, for signature. Expectation management Overall, if no vulnerabilities are found, this process has been taking approximately 2 weeks for test preparation and system security plan writing and 2 weeks for greybox testing and signature. Since the time it would take to resolve vulnerabilities is not known until a vulnerability is identified, it is strongly recommended that no expectations are set with Federal partners or GSA stakeholders when public testing will begin. Instead, we recommend that the authorization process is seen as part of the delivery process and your definition of \"done\". After the system has been authorized, you can then begin planning a public roll out of your test system. 1 Year authorization The 1 Year is inclusive of all the steps of the 90 Day process. A more thorough penetration test is done, which may reveal other vulnerabilities that will need to be resolved. Continuous authorization Coming soon.

Everything collected here is mandatory. We design standards for: simplicity delight safety Our objective is to deliver the best environment to do development work in the Federal government. Unfortunately, sometimes law or policy at a higher level (ex: GSA or OMB), directly conflicts with our design goals and our objective. We constantly negotiate for improvements. The work here is also subject to constant improvement. Pull requests from anyone at 18F, from any team, are strongly encouraged. AWS Slack GitHub Security Terms and Conditions A quick note on delight In User Experience, the concept of \"delight\" is often referenced. Beyond being of value, in and of itself, delight is often used as a piece of gold standard user feedback that some piece of UX is actually working. For a DevOps team, the core goal is for a fantastic Developer Experience. Without diving so deep into the intricacies of user or developer experience, most developers would agree that a great experience is one that keeps them in flow and makes them feel like an expert. Delight shouldn't be a success metric just for public facing systems - it also helps guide the development of internal systems.

Background 18F is a digital services delivery team located within the General Services Administration (GSA). We are a team of public servants who work as developers, designers, and bureaucracy hackers. Our mission (and strategy) is to deliver great software at low cost to our Federal partners. 18F's expertise is in software delivery, human centered design, and agile consulting. Delivery methodology 18F follows a simplified four-phase software development cycle, which is integrated with our human centered design process. While the phase of a latest release is listed on our dashboard, the work is iterative and cyclical, as new research leads to producing new functionality. Discovery To be included. Alpha To be included. Beta To be included. Live To be included. Development operations (DevOps) For software that we develop, procure, or operate at 18F, our DevOps team will provide continuous: configuration management - we use tools such as Chef and Cloudformation to represent our infrastructure as code (IaC). Ensuring your entire system as IaC ensures a high degree of repeatability, auditability, and security. Just like all of our code, we check our IaC into a distributed version control system (DVCS) using git. monitoring - we use tools such as Cloudtrail and Splunk integration and deployment - we use tools such as Capistrano and Jenkins incident response - if there is an incident on your systems, we will contact your Technical Lead per the Federal incident notification guidelines. T We work closely and monitor alerts from US-CERT and the open source community more broadly. Service standards An open source team We place a premium on developing digital services in the open. Doing so improves everything we create. Our policy is to pursue these goals: use Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) in our projects and to contribute back to the open source community; create an environment where any project can be developed in the open publish all source code created or modified by 18F publicly A FOSS project provides critical technical benefits like unrestrained product customization and interoperability between tools. Other benefits include: Flexible usage: open source is particularly suitable for rapid prototyping and experimentation. The testing process generates minimal costs, and the process encourages the identification and elimination of defects not recognized by the original development team. Community involvement: publicly available source code enables continuous and broad peer review. Whether simply publishing the completed code or opening the development process, the practice of expanding the review and testing process to a wider audience—beyond the development team—ensures increased software reliability and security. Developing in the open also allows for other opinions to help adjust the direction of a product to maximize its usefulness to the community it serves Cost-savings: the ability to modify FOSS enables 18F to respond rapidly to changing missions and markets. Support and maintenance of open source code—as opposed to more burdensome usages of proprietary software—provides a real cost advantage where multiple copies of software are required, or when the user base grows. The total cost of ownership is shared with a community, rather than solely 18F. Reusability: the code we create belongs to the American people as a part of the public domain. The code we work on was paid for by the American people, but the end-product is not the only way they should be able to interact with their government. By coding in FOSS, we help populate a larger commons that cities, states, businesses, and citizens can participate in. This creates real economic value by lowering the burden of replicating similar work or by allowing the private sector to build off of and create new businesses around code developed at 18F. The 18F open source policy was developed after consulting previous work done by the Department of Defense (DoD), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). IPv6 While 18F and GSA fully concurs with the move to IPv6, currently AWS does not support IPv6 in VPCs. The operational performance and security gains achieved by this best practice architecture outweigh the IPv6 compliance need. This is one area where OMB's \"cloud first\" initiatives directly contradict other guidance. The main purpose of the IPv6 policy is to ensure Federal operations are not disrupted by an eventual exhaustion of IPv4 addresses. AWS has been very proactive in obtaining IPv4 blocks for its customers and we do not anticipate any disruption of operations. One strategy that 18F uses to mitigate the risks of IPv4 address exhaustion is through the use of Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs). ELBs themselves are a single IP that sits atop a pool of private instances - the ELB itself is an abstraction that does not provide a \"true\" IPv4 address, but instead is a FQDN that dynamically represents the pool of private instances. 18F always pre-reserves an address for its ELBs, so long before we enter production, we know if there will be an issue. At the same time, many of our Federal partners, (inclusive of GSA itself) does not have IPv6 compatible network systems, making it impossible to successfully test IPv6 functionality within the networks we operate. So even if IPv6 capabilities were deployed tomorrow, we would be reticent to make commitments to a feature we ourselves cannot test. AWS is planning on deploying IPv6 capabilities to VPCs in the future and long before the IPv4 exhaustion impacts AWS customers such as 18F. We hope GSA and our partners have fully enabled internal and external IPv6 networks by that point. Software as a service 18F uses industry-standard infrastructure as a service (IaaS) solutions to deliver software as a service (SaaS) to our partners. Under this model, 18F abstracts all the complexity away from you. When 18F is selected to provide SaaS for our partners, we need certain guarantees of operational and infrastructural autonomy to effectively fulfill our mission of delivering government services, securely, speedily, and at scale. In exchange for this autonomy, 18F provides unprecedented operational transparency to our partners. This enables our partners to rely on our operations, without being subject to unpredictable manual processes. This also allows us to deliver results at a fraction of the time and cost. We manage: infrastructure procurement security privacy information collections Amazon Web Services We currently offer only one IaaS solution, Amazon Web Services (AWS) in the US-East/US-West (E/W) regions and in the AWS GovCloud. We operate our IaaS under a DevOps model. While we do have a fundamental \"separation of concerns\" between our developers and our operations staff (engineering, architecture, and cybersecurity), under DevOps, these teams work closely together to deliver working software. Everyone is responsible for every step in the process to deliver software into production. 18F strongly recommends the use of the AWS E/W for all net-new system development, unless you require compliance with [International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)](https://www.pmddtc.state.gov/regulations_laws/itar.html]. There are multiple value-added components within AWS E/W that are unavailable in the AWS GovCloud; many of these directly help with the auditability and security of the system. AWS E/W services are also available at a lower rate than those in the AWS GovCloud. DNS delegation 18F will manage the Domain Name System (DNS) for any service's second-level domains or above. This means that DNS responsibility is fully delegated to 18F’s infrastructure. 18F leverages AWS' world-class DNS solution, Route53, to load balance your application and provide an unparalleled level of availability, disaster recovery, and overall system flexibility. DNS services are only available if 18F is hosting your system. Partners should expect to create point name server (NS) records pointing to 18F's infrastructure for all relevant domains. 'relevant domain or sub-domain’s nameservers to 18F. Any further DNS records (such as but not limited to MX, A, TXT, or CNAME records) will be managed inside 18F’s DNS and infrastructure providers. This also requiresmeans that 18F expects that services projects to be deployed to unique domains or subdomains (e.g. newserviceproject.agency.gov), and not at URL paths on existing domains (e.g. agency.gov/newservicenewproject). Full DNS delegation allows 18F to manage resources in a rapid, flexible, and auditable manner without prolonged or frequent manual actions, which are prone to mis-communication, delays, and failures.agency coordination. It also allows us to provision secondary resources that use the domain, and to confirm domain ownership to third parties when necessary to provide additional services to our partners. DNSSEC capabilities at the recursive nameserver level are not currently available using this service. As none of the major web browsers currently support DNSSEC validation capabilities, true DNSSEC compliance is not yet achievable, regardless of your DNS provider. Additional challenges with DNSSEC is that if you are already using a content delivery network (CDN) like Akamai, Cloudfront, or Cloudflare you are already out of compliance with DNSSEC, since no Federal CDN vendor has yet to solve the problem of dynamically changing zone files with millions of entries every few seconds. 18F is committed to working with the community on DNSSEC and DNS security in general. We will closely monitor browser DNSSEC capabilities along with other clients and actively explore compensating controls. To ameliorate this issue, if you are connecting into 18F’s backend systems to exchange sensitive data, we ensure you are working with the correct IP address before activating an exchange. If you are connecting into 18F’s front-end systems (like an API) to exchange sensitive data, we will use the appropriate authentication mechanism (e.g., API keys, TLS encryption, OAuth 2.0) to protect your data. DNSSEC encryption between nameservers is available from the root domain, to the .gov domain, and to your second-level domain (e.g. agency.gov). Digital certificate management 18F will manage the approval, issuance, renewal, and overall lifecycle of all digital certificates required for the operation of services. This includes but is not limited to digital certificates required to enable Transport Layer Security (TLS) or other public-key infrastructures (PKI). DNS delegation, as described above, is both necessary and sufficient to ensure that 18F can prove domain ownership and issue TLS certificates. Procurement We maintain blanket purchase agreements (BPAs) and issue task orders for specific clients if additional infrastructure capacity is needed on the procurement vehicle. We have Federal staff available to help you create an independent government cost estimate (IGCE) for your future costs. Security We only use FedRAMP IaaS at 18F. The FedRAMP program is run by our colleagues at GSA, with additional partners at the DoD, DHS, and NIST. FedRAMP is an extension of the controls recommended by the NIST 800-53 guidance. It's specifically targeted at \"cloud solutions\" like IaaS. Both AWS E/W (Virginia, Oregon, California) and the AWS GovCloud are located in the continental United States. When appropriate, our systems go through a formal FISMA process to obtain an Authority to Operate (ATO) which includes: software test coverage continuous configuration management, monitoring, and integration/deployment. vulnerability scanning (e.g., Nessus, Tripwire) static code analysis (e.g., HP Fortify, Checkmarx, Hariki) penetration testing system security plan Privacy We conduct our own privacy impact assessments (PIAs) and file system of records notices (SORNs) when appropriate. Information collection We conduct our own Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) clearances and have a close working relationship with OIRA/OMB. Infrastructure as a service If you deploy your own services on our IaaS, you are completely responsible for the compliance, performance, and operation of your systems. Shared responsibility In cases where you have engineers, developers, or other users who wish to share the responsibility of the system with 18F, we are able to provision your users if they meet the above standards. Depending on the nature of the responsibility, your users would have \"administrative-like\" permissions but only to VPCs that pertain to your systems. These users must go through the same training as 18F staff, regardless of their expertise with AWS or any other infrastructure. Experience with Linux, preferably Debian/Ubuntu but RedHat Enterprise Linux or CentOS is acceptable, is also required for access. Service Level Agreement [ServiceName] Background [insert content here] Scope “[ServiceName]” means major releases of the software (e.g., 1.x, 2.x) in its final production architecture. This agreement does not include releases before a 1.0, or in a non-production architecture (dev, test, QA, performance testing, etc). 18F will strive to meet all SLA requirements for all releases, but these cannot be guaranteed. Definitions 18F follows a simplified four-phase software development cycle, which is integrated with our human centered design process. While the phase of a latest release is listed on our dashboard, the work is iterative and cyclical, as new research leads to producing new functionality. Response Time and capacity management Ninetieth (90th) percentile response time of a webpage request should be within 7 seconds. In cases where there is a temporary or permanent surge in traffic that is resulting in slower response times, the AWS infrastructure will scale-up automatically using pre-deployed scripts in order to speed-up response times. Due the high-profile nature of the [ServiceName] program, there will be spikes in website traffic as a result of promotional campaign activities and media coverage. To ensure the highest levels of availability and performance, the Treasury Product Owner should communicate to the 18F Product Lead in advance of such planned or known events. The lead time for such notices can be as short as 1 hour. Uptime 18F inherits the uptime numbers in the AWS Service Level Agreement (SLA). You can find the SLA of some of the most common AWS components online: EC2 S3 RDS At the application level, 18F strives for 99% uptime. We don't yet have any historical data substantiating our application level uptime, since we're a new team. Any outage at the application level will trigger an automated alert to our support team who will act to restore the service to full operation (e.g., workaround) immediately. We will notify the Treasury Technical Lead of the outage within 2 hours along with an explanation of the outage and steps to remediate the underlying cause(s) within seven (7) business days. Infrastructure failover [ServiceName] will be setup in the AWS US-East region in multiple zones. In the event of a multi-zone failure in the AWS US-East region, we will deploy the [ServiceName] website to the AWS US-West region within 2 hours. Data ownership Data and source code for the [ServiceName] system, and all of its dependencies, can be exported and transferred at any time, at no cost to you. Finances We manage our federal partnerships through interagency agreements (IAAs) with program offices at Federal agencies. Everything we do is managed under a \"charge back\" model. We charge for our time, our infrastructure, and our platforms. While our time and our platforms may have a small amount of overhead, this is purely for our general team operations. We do not make a profit and are expressly prohibited from doing so. Our infrastructure is pure pass-thru. We don't charge any overhead or fees for its use - whatever we pay our vendors is what you pay. Design and code fixes (needs to be worked into a proper template) 18F identifies issues from a variety of sources such as direct user feedback provided to XXX via the email [ServiceName]@XXX.gov or phone number 800-553-2663 posted on the website, ongoing user research and testing, issues reported by the public directly to the [ServiceName] Github repo, and the Treasury Product Owner. Per the 18F-XXX IAA, the XXX Product Owner determines the priority of all product backlog items, including bugs. The 18F delivery team will work to implement and deploy those items in a manner that is commensurate with the priority (e.g., if the retirement savings calculator is not functioning as intended, a fix will be deployed as soon as possible). All product backlog items, including bugs, are recorded in the [ServiceName] Github repo. Each issue logged is labeled according to priority, workflow status, etc. Those with the highest level priorities will be implemented and deployed first. Third-party services (needs work) 18F uses multiple third-party services to help ensure the quality and security of [ServiceName]. Email marketing We use MailChimp to handle email marketing campaigns. We have accepted the Terms of Service and cybersecurity risk of the underlying technology behind MailChimp and administrative access to the platform is limited to the 18F DevOps team via two-factor authentication.

All requests for leave should be submitted in ALOHA to the administrative supervisor or designee. Do this at least three business days in advance. For now, Aaron Snow is everyone's administrative supervisor. In the future, the administrative supervisor will be the person listed as your supervisor in our organizational charts. If your administrative supervisor is out (say on vacation) they can designate leave approval authority to another person. In the case of emergency or illness, you can ask for permission for absence from your administrative supervisor (or designee) no later than two hours before the start of your typical work day, in your typical time zone. Requests for annual or sick leave must be made on each day of absence, unless otherwise arranged. Failure to do so can result in the denial of leave, which can lead to a charge of absence without leave (AWOL). AWOL is an unauthorized or un-approved absence from duty, and can be the basis for disciplinary action. Telework Telework provides valuable flexibility to employees. It increases morale, productivity, and collaboration among peers. The 18F office recognizes these benefits and encourages the use of telework within the parameters described below. This policy adheres to and is in conjunction with GSA's Mobility and Telework Policy. Employees can telework with the approval of their administrative supervisor or his/her designee. Maximum number of days You can telework up to six days per two-week pay period.This is maximum telework allowed in adherence to the intent of the Mobility and Telework Policy. Infrequently, you may telework additional days on a case-by-case basis and with supervisory approval. See also: Telework Policy Supplement for Members of TeamOps Culture While your administrative supervisor officially approves telework days, our office culture calls on employees to keep their project teams and duty-station co-workers apprised of telework days. Accomplish this through any of our designated communication channels. Alternative worksite location As an employee, it's your responsibility to ensure alternative worksites provide the work environment, connectivity, technology, resource access, and security consistent with the work you're doing. In other words, you need to be aware of security, internet access, and similar concerns. This is explained further in the \"Connectivity\" section below. You must be available to the team as if you were \"in the office.\" Supervisors can overrule any employee-selected alternative worksite location if they feel it isn't business appropriate or fails to provide a working environment compliant with the conditions outlined in GSA’s Mobility and Telework Policy. Without prior approval, you may not work outside your local commuting area. \"Local commuting areas\" explained \"Local communting areas\" are totally subjective and not defined either in law or in GSA policy, even though the subjective definition is set in code. Ultimately, it's up to a supervisor to define the local commuting area for a particular team. \"Outside the local commuting area\" does apply to employees working from other GSA offices. For example, an employee stationed in San Francisco who flies to Chicago to work in the GSA Chicago office is \"outside the local commuting area\" and must obtain prior, supervisory approval. Working at another office As outlined above, you can work in an office other than your official duty location, with prior approval. This is called \"alternative officing\" and isn't considered teleworking. Connectivity As a teleworker, it's your responsibility to ensure your alternative worksite has voice and computer connectivity capability. If you experience a power outage or interruption in internet access, you can work on tasks that don't require connectivity; do this in consultation with your supervisor. Alternatively, you can report to your official worksite or take leave. If your telework status or telework schedule change, let your administrative supervisor know immediately. For example, \"Working from home today, but I'll be in the office tomorrow!\" Schedule If you're required to report to an official worksite on a scheduled telework day, you'll usually be given at least one business day of notice. If that isn't possible, your administrative supervisor or designee will notify you as soon as possible. For example, telework schedules may need adjustment for business needs, like mandatory meetings or office coverage. You need to follow leave procedures on telework days. For example, if you have a doctor's appointment during work hours, request and obtain approval for that leave time. In the event of inclement weather or other disruption, OPM or another authorized organization may announce \"Unscheduled Telework\" (posted on www.opm.gov). On those days, you can take advantage of unscheduled telework if you have a computer available to conduct your work as well as sufficient work to fill the \"Unscheduled Telework\" hours. If you don't have a government-issued computer on hand, you can use a personal computer. You should notify your administrative supervisor of your intention to telework before the scheduled start of the work day. Security Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and other secure information, including information protected by the Privacy Act, must be maintained in accordance with the GSA Rules of Behavior for Handling Personally Identifiable Information, Order HCO 2180.1, paragraph 7. Teleworkers must successfully complete the following required GSA On-Line University courses before beginning (or in order to continue) teleworking: \"Telework Works\" and \"Annual Privacy Training 101 and IT Security Awareness.\" In addition, within 90 days of beginning telework, teleworkers must also take and successfully complete the following On-Line University courses, as appropriate: Telework Works for employees; or (2) Managing Distributed Teams for managers. Sensitive material, including information protected by the Privacy Act, must be viewed only on government issued equipment or via Citrix. No information may be stored or saved to non-government issued equipment. Family members and friends of the teleworker are not authorized to use the government issued equipment. It is the employees’ responsibility to ensure that they have all of the necessary files at their telework worksite and that they are complying with GSA policies regarding the handling and securing of GSA Records and Files and Personally Identifiable Information (PII). (1) Employees may physically transport GSA files to their telework worksite prior to teleworking. It is the employee’s responsibility to safeguard and protect all GSA files in their possession while teleworking and while transporting the files to and from the telework worksite. (2) Employees may also digitally scan GSA files to create an electronic document, which can be used while teleworking. It is the employee’s responsibility to ensure that the electronic document is legible prior to teleworking. Important points Detailed employees shall enter into telework agreements with their detailed supervisors. Telework is not a substitute for dependent care, e.g., child care or elder care. Telework is not a substitute for sick leave. You're bound by the Standards of Ethical Conduct while working at an alternative worksite and using government equipment. Teleworking is a privilege and not an entitlement. Virtual worker agreements 18F makes use of virtual worker agreements when employees live outside official duty stations. For example, we have employees in Portland, Atlanta, and Dayton but no established 18F office location. Once a geographic area has enough employees to warrant an official office, one is established. For example, San Francisco and New York City are now official office locations. When an official office is established, all virtual workers in that location become teleworkers."},{"title":"TeamOps Processes - Referrals and Interviews","url":"/hub/team-ops/processes/referrals-and-interviews/","tags":[],"body":"TeamOps Processes - Referrals and Interviews To Refer Someone: Add Names to This Form Please be sure to include any information you have on the candidate including contact information, current employer, current location, primary and secondary skill set, and any additional information you may have in the notes section.

Inlcuding: Alphabetical Listing of Visitor’s Name Agency/Company Name Point of Contact Name, Room Number and Phone Number For meetings with 15 or more attendees, it is recommended that they be asked to arrive at least 45 minutes early to avoid long lines and delays in the lobby area and to be able to report to the meeting on time. Also, here is the link: https://insite.gsa.gov/portal/content/502484 Support Pia Scott can provide support to organize and coordinate logistics for events we host. After Hours Events \"I received notification from Building Management that events after 6:30 p.m. require two guards. There is a four-hour minimum. The cost is $59 per hour ($236). The required payment method is the Charge Card. The request for guard service must be submitted at least two weeks in advance. If the events ends at 6:30 p.m., additional guard service is not required.\" If the event begins before 5 p.m. then additional security will not be required. We will need a security sponsor, who will be responsible for non-federal visitors entering the building. We will need to provide security with at least two federal employees to sign-in the visitors. Security is requesting that visitors enter through the E Street entrance (back of building). Visitors must have a valid government-issued ID (Government ID or Driver's License) to obtain access to the building (no exceptions will be allowed). Screenings are required for non-federal visitors. Visitor should arrive 30-45 minutes before the event. The event must begin before 5 p.m. to be exempt from the additional security. Late arrivals will not be admitted after 6 p.m., or additional security will be required. Advertising Once there's a registration form, there are several ways to advertise the event across the .gov scene. Below are various forums for posting to, but be sure to only send to relevant groups. * Government APIs * Government Open Source * Open Data listserv: Email listserv@listserv.gsa.gov with no subject and “subscribe open-data” in the body. * UX Community of Practice: Email listserv@listserv.gsa.gov with no subject and “subscribe ux-cop” in the body. * Open Government * Web Content Managers Listserve * DigitalGov * Social Media Community of Practice Also be sure to tweet about events from the 18F Twitter account and consider employing the 18F mail list that has been accumulating.

An Interagency Agreement (IAA) allows us to provide services to your agency. Essentially, it's a more formal Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), composed of standard terms, two Treasury forms, and a specific set of legal authorities.1 We move our clients through the IAA process as quickly and painlessly as we can, and we're available to help every step of the way. 1Generally, 18F executes IAAs under the Economy Act, 31 U.S.C. § 1535. Q: Who are the parties to an IAA? The two parties are formally known as the requesting agency (that's you!) and the servicing agency (us). Q: What are the required components? We use two, Treasury-recommended forms: The 7600A, for general terms and conditions The 7600B, for the order requirements and funding information. The general terms broadly outline the nature and scope of engagement between our agencies. Completing this form doesn't bind or obligate either party to perform or pay. The order requirements hash out a project's specifics. Think of it as a task order or work order submitted to a vendor: it spells out the statement of work, project cost, and performance period. There's only ever one set of general terms, but you can issue multiple order requirements for different projects or performance periods. Q: What if I have questions about the forms? Our staff will help you complete all parts of the the forms, including filling in necessary boxes. If you're interested in more general information, read the information about the standard forms and instructions published on the Department of the Treasury website. Q: What’s the difference between an \"agreement period\" and a \"period of performance?\" An agreement period is set in the general terms. Depending on the nature of the engagement, this may be multiple years. The performance period is set in the order requirements. It's specific to a particular project and obligates both parties: During that time period, we're required to perform our tasks, and you're required to pay the actual costs we incur. Find more information from Treasury's Fiscal Management Service website. Q: Does an IAA encumber or obligate any funds? Yes, but only when your agency issues its first order requirements. At that point, your agency’s finance office will obligate the amount of funds indicated on the 7600B. As we invoice for services or products delivered, those obligated funds are transferred as payment. Of course, if the project comes in under budget, your finance office can deobligate any unused funds and use them for other purposes. Additionally, we comply with federal law that requires full cost recovery, and the cost may increase if the project costs are more than our original estimate. Q: Does my contracting officer need to approve an IAA? It depends. Every agency has different policies on who can sign the IAA. You should check with your office of the chief financial officer to find out who can sign these documents. Generally, approval requires a program official with designated authority to sign the agreement as well as a representative of the chief financial officer with the authority to sign the agreement and obligate the funds. Find more information on Treasury's Fiscal Management Service website. Q: What is a determination and findings? A determination and findings statement we enter into the IAA under the authority of the Economy Act, which is common. This statement needs to include all three of these provisions: The IAA is in the best interest of the government. The product or services cannot be obtained conveniently or economically by contracting with a private source. 18F has the capability or expertise to provide services not available within your agency. Q: Where is the scope and/or statement of work? The statement of work is found in \"Attachment A\" to Form 7600B. Q: What information should I gather to complete an IAA? The key component of an IAA is agreement between our agencies on the statement of work. This is the “meat” of our agreement. It spells out the reason you're engaging us and what we'll deliver. At the start of the IAA process, we'll draft a proposed statement of work and share it with you for comment. Once we both agree on the statement of work, you should gather the following pieces of administrative information: Name of requesting office: The full office name and postal address of the specific office requesting the services. Name of program official: The full name, title, and email address of the person in your agency with the authority to sign the IAA. Name of funding official: The full name, title, and email address of the person in your agency with authority to obligate the funds needed for the IAA. Type of money: This is a description of the funds being used. For example, \"one-year,\" \"multi-year,\" or \"no-year.\" Financial codes: ALC, TAS, BETC, and BPN from your finance office. We'll send you the IAA Form Preparation Survey to collect this information and populate the IAA forms maker. You can view the information required on the survey using the IAA Form Preparation PDF. Q: How long should I expect the IAA process to take? We view the IAA process as a means to an end, and the end is the successful delivery of products and services to our clients. That said, our work can't commence without an IAA in place. Typically, this takes about four weeks from the date a client and 18F decide to work together. A large chunk of that time is spent finalizing the statement of work. Throughout the process, we're willing and available to resolve any questions or concerns you might have. Q: Who do I contact if I have further questions? We're here to help.

We are a team of civil servants who work as developers, designers, and bureaucracy hackers. Our mission (and strategy) is to deliver great software at low cost to our Federal partners. 18F's expertise is in iterative software development, infrastructure as a service (IaaS), and DevOps. myRA Background myRA is a static website developed and hosted by 18F. It is entirely written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Content is created in Markdown and then rendered into HTML pages using Jekyll. Neither is a dependency - the site could be maintained and run with pure HTML content. They exist as a convenience to content creators who many not have the prerequisite knowledge to write HTML. Definitions “myRA” means major releases of the software (ex: 1.x, 2.x) in its final production architecture. Capacity assessment myRA will be able to support per month: 100,000 pageviews 100,000 email subscribers 1,200,000 emails Data ownership Data and source code for the myRA system, and all of its dependencies, can be exported and transferred at any time, at no cost to you. Operational and finance model We manage our federal partnerships through interagency agreements (IAAs) with program offices at Federal agencies. Everything we do is managed under a \"charge back\" model. We charge for our time, our infrastructure, and our platforms. While our time and our platforms may have a small amount of overhead, this is purely for our general team operations. We do not make a profit and are expressly prohibited from doing so. Our infrastructure is pure pass-thru. We don't charge any overhead or fees for its use - whatever we pay our vendors is what you pay. An open source team We place a premium on developing digital tools and services in the open. Doing so improves the final product we create. Our policy is to pursue these goals: use Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) in our projects and to contribute back to the open source community; create an environment where any project can be developed in the open publish all source code created or modified by 18F publicly A FOSS project provides critical technical benefits like unrestrained product customization and interoperability between tools. Other benefits include: Flexible usage: open source is particularly suitable for rapid prototyping and experimentation. The testing process generates minimal costs, and the process encourages the identification and elimination of defects not recognized by the original development team. Community involvement: publicly available source code enables continuous and broad peer review. Whether simply publishing the completed code or opening the development process, the practice of expanding the review and testing process to a wider audience—beyond the development team—ensures increased software reliability and security. Developing in the open also allows for other opinions to help adjust the direction of a product to maximize its usefulness to the community it serves Cost-savings: the ability to modify FOSS enables 18F to respond rapidly to changing missions and markets. Support and maintenance of open source code—as opposed to more burdensome usages of proprietary software—provides a real cost advantage where multiple copies of software are required, or when the user base grows. The total cost of ownership is shared with a community, rather than solely 18F. Reusability: the code we create belongs to the American people as a part of the public domain. The code we work on was paid for by the American people, but the end-product is not the only way they should be able to interact with their government. By coding in FOSS, we help populate a larger commons that cities, states, businesses, and citizens can participate in. This creates real economic value by lowering the burden of replicating similar work or by allowing the private sector to build off of and create new businesses around code developed at 18F. The 18F open source policy was developed after consulting previous work done by the Department of Defense (DoD), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Infrastructure as a Service (as a Service) 18F uses industry standard IaaS solutions to deliver software as a service (SaaS) to our partners. Under this model, 18F abstracts all the complexity away from you. We manage: the infrastructure itself - we currently offer only one IaaS solution, Amazon Web Services (AWS) in the US-East/US-West (E/W) regions and in the AWS GovCloud. We operate our IaaS under a DevOps model. While we do have a fundamental \"separation of concerns\" between our developers and our operations staff (engineering, architecture, and cybersecurity), under DevOps, these teams work closely together to deliver working software. Everyone is responsible for every step in the process to deliver software into production. procurement - we maintain blanket purchase agreements (BPAs) and issue task orders for specific clients if additional capacity is needed on the procurement vehicle. We have Federal staff available to help you create an independent government cost estimate (IGCE) for your future costs. cybersecurity compliance - we only use FedRAMP IaaS at 18F. The FedRAMP program run by our colleagues at GSA, with additional partners at the DoD, DHS, and NIST. FedRAMP is an extension of the controls recommended by the NIST 800-53 guidance. It's specifically targeted at \"cloud solutions\" like IaaS. Both AWS E/W (Virginia, Oregon, California) and the AWS GovCloud are located in the continental United States. When appropriate, our systems go through a formal FISMA process to obtain an Authority to Operate (ATO) which includes: software test coverage continuous configuration management, monitoring, and integration/deployment. vulnerability scanning (Nessus, Tripwire) static code analysis (HP Fortify, Checkmarx, Hariki) penetration testing system security plan privacy compliance - we conduct our own privacy impact assessments (PIAs) and file system of records notices (SORNs) where appropriate. Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) - we conduct our own PRAs and have a close working relationship with OIRA/OMB. 18F strongly recommends the use of the AWS E/W for all net-new system development, unless you require compliance with [International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)](https://www.pmddtc.state.gov/regulations_laws/itar.html]. There are multiple value-added components within AWS E/W that are unavailable in the AWS GovCloud; many of these directly help with the auditability and security of the system. AWS E/W services are also available at a lower rate than those in the AWS GovCloud. If you deploy your own applications on our IaaS, you are completely responsible for the compliance, performance, and operation of your systems. Uptime 18F inherits the uptime numbers in the AWS Service Level Agreement (SLA). You can find the SLA of some of the most common AWS components online: EC2 S3 RDS At the application level, 18F strives for 99% uptime. We don't yet have any historical data substantiating our application level uptime, since we're a new team. Any outage at the application level will result in a notification to you within 24 hours, with an explanation of the outage and remediation steps within seven (7) business days. DevOps For software that we develop, procure, or operate at 18F, our DevOps team will provide continuous: configuration management - we use Chef or Puppet, and Cloudformation to represent our infrastructure as code (IaC). Ensuring your entire system as IaC ensures a high degree of repeatability, auditability, and security. Just like all of our code, we check our IaC into a distributed version control system (DVCS) using git. monitoring - we use Cloudtrail and Splunk integration and deployment - we use Capistrano and Jenkins incident response - if there is an incident on your systems, we will contact your Technical Lead within 24 hours or as soon as any immediate threat is resolved. We work closely and monitor alerts from US-CERT and the open source community more broadly. Concept of Operations The 18F DevOps team manages the AWS infrastructure, in direct collaboration and consultation with our senior application developers and the GSA Security Engineering team. The root user is Noah Kunin, 18F's Delivery Architect (noah.kunin@gsa.gov). Administrative users (with almost all the powers of the root user) are limited to users trained on AWS. All users, regardless of their permission levels, must sign into the platform using a password of [insert entropy here] and using 2-factor authentication (2FA). Firewalls and overall data flow through the system are maintained by the usage of security groups. Each resource in AWS is limited by a pure whitelist - an 18F administrator must specifically enumerate ports. Each system developed by 18F receives its own internet gateway and virtual private cloud (VPC) to logically separate it from other systems in the environment. Identity access management is mediated through permission policies written in JSON. SSH Key-pairs are then assigned to appropriate users. Key-pairs are only ever stored in a GSA enclave or locally on staff laptops. The security group policy on the VPC or specific instance then limits SSH access to a GSA CIDR block, or other known and trusted entities based on system design or functionality. 18F works hard to ensure every component of our applications, and as much of our IaaS as possible, is based on free and open source (FOSS) technologies and we have the strongest FOSS policy in the Federal community to back it up. We always evaluate open source solutions first. If you choose not to use 18F's IaaS in the future, the vast majority of the system should be able to be transferred without any need to purchase licenses or negotiate intellectual property rights. 18F will provide you a comprehensive system architecture diagram before your system moves into production, noting where non-open source components are used. Shared responsibility In cases where you have engineers, developers, or other users who wish to share the responsibility of the system with 18F, we are able to provision your users if they meet the above standards. Depending on the nature of the responsibility, your users would have \"administrative-like\" permissions but only to VPCs that pertain to your systems. These users must go through the same training as 18F staff, regardless of their expertise with AWS or any other infrastructure. Experience with Linux, preferably Debian/Ubuntu but RedHat Enterprise Linux or CentOS is acceptable, is also required for access. Technical service notes Ancillary to our application development and DevOps are other services your system may need when deployed to production. Domain Name Service (DNS) 18F leverages AWS' world-class DNS solution, Route53, to load balance your application and provide an unparalleled level of availability, disaster recovery, and overall system flexibility. DNS services are only available if 18F is hosting your system. If you require a: second-level domain (example.gov): 18F will work with the Federal CIO, OMB, and the DotGov.gov team (located at GSA) on your behalf to get the necessary permissions to launch. third-level domain (example.youragencyhere.gov): 18F will work with your Network team to establish a CNAME record (an alias) from the desired URL to the 18F AWS infrastructure. This is usually achieved by your Network team adding a CNAME record for the URL to the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the primary Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) on your system. You can also fully delegate control over the third-level domain over to 18F. fourth-level domains and above: 18F does not recommend the use of publicly accessible domains beyond the third-level. They are difficult to type for users and difficult to use in marketing and communications. If you think you have a discrete need for a fourth-level or higher domain, please contact 18F as soon as possible, so we can first look at re-architecting your system. Fourth-level and higher domains are appropriate for non-production environments (ex: staging.example.youragencyhere.gov) DNSSEC capabilities are not currently available using this service. As none of the major web browsers currently support DNSSEC validation capabilities, true DNSSEC compliance is not yet achievable, regardless of your DNS provider. The other challenge with DNSSEC is that if you are already using a content delivery network (CDN) like Akamai, you are already out of compliance with DNSSEC, since no Federal CDN vendor has yet to solve the problem of dynamically changing zone files with millions of entries every few seconds. 18F is committed to working with the community on DNSSEC and DNS security in general. We will closely monitor browser DNSSEC capabilities along with other clients and actively explore compensating controls. In the meantime, if you are connecting into 18F’s backend systems to exchange sensitive data, we ensure you are working with the correct IP address before activating an exchange. If you are connecting into 18F’s front-end systems (like an API) to exchange sensitive data, we use API keys to authenticate identities and strong SSL/TLS encryption to protect your data. IPv6 While 18F and GSA fully concurs with the move to IPv6, currently AWS does not support IPv6 for Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) in VPCs. The operational performance and security gains achieved by this best practice architecture outweigh the IPv6 compliance need. This is one area where OMB's \"cloud first\" initiatives directly contradict other guidance. The main purpose of the IPv6 policy is to ensure Federal operations are not disrupted by an eventual exhaustion of IPv4 addresses. AWS has been very proactive in obtaining IPv4 blocks for its customers and we do not anticipate any disruption of operations. ELBs are themselves a single IP that sits atop a pool of private instances - the ELB itself is an abstraction that does not provide a \"true\" IPv4 address, but instead is a FQDN that dynamically represents the pool of private instances. 18F always pre-reserves an address for its ELBs, so long before we enter production, we know if there will be an issue. At the same time, many of our Federal partners, (inclusive of GSA itself) does not have IPv6 compatible network systems, making it impossible to successfully test IPv6 functionality within the networks we operate. So even if IPv6 capabilities were deployed tomorrow, we would be reticent to make commitments to a feature we ourselves cannot test. AWS is planning on deploying IPv6 capabilities to VPC ELBs in the future and long before the IPv4 exhaustion impacts AWS customers such as 18F. We hope GSA and our partners have fully enabled internal and external IPv6 networks by that point. myRA Compliance Architecture We have prepared the following breakdown of various compliance checks: Section 508: myRA will receive a 508 analysis from a trained evaluator. PRA: No OMB control # is required as the myRA site does not collect any information via methods that fall under the SORN: No SORN is required as no information that falls under the Privacy Act is collected. The following datum is collected from potential myRA users: email. Emails that are not paired with a verifiable identifier cannot be PII as the identity of the individual who submits the email cannot be directly or indirectly inferreed. The following data is collected from employers: company name, number of employees. Employers acting in their official capacity are not afforded Privacy Act rights. Individuals who are sole-proprietorships will be directed to the Individual sign-up page. All data is collected before the site starts to link to the fiscal agent system. After the fiscal agent's system launches, no data will be collected on the myRA system. Overall analytics data will be collected via the GSA-run Government Enterprise Google Analytics account as long as the system is in operation. ATO: After leveraging FedRAMP controls, we will assess myRA for the following controls: AC-2 Account Management AU-2 Audit Events AU-6 Audit Review, Analysis, and Reporting CM-3 Configuration Change Control CM-6 Configuration Settings IA-2 Identification and Authentication (Organizational Users) IA-2 (1) Identification and Authentication (Organizational Users) | Network Access to Privileged Accounts IA-2 (2) Identification and Authentication (Organizational Users) | Network Access to Non-Privileged Accounts PL-8 Information Security Architecture SI-2 Flaw Remediation SI-10 Information Input Validation CA-8 Penetration Testing RA-5 Vulnerability Scanning SA-11 (1) Developer Security Testing and Evaluation | Static Code Analysis CM-2 Baseline Configuration SC-7 Boundary Protection CM-8 Information System Component Inventory myRA uses MailChimp to handle email addresses. We have accepted the Terms of Service and cybersecurity risk of the underlying technology behind MailChimp and administrative access to the platform is limited to the 18F DevOps team via two-factor authentication. 18F Current Clients The following agencies are already hosting development or production systems with 18F: United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Department of Education (DoED) Federal Elections Commission (FEC) Department of Justice (DoJ) General Services Administration (GSA) Contact information General inquiries: 18F@gsa.gov DevOps: devops@gsa.gov Interagency Agreements: Aaron Snow, aaron.snow@gsa.gov myRA Project Lead: Chris Cairns, christopher.cairns@gsa.gov myRA Technical and Design Lead: Noah Manger, noah.manger@gsa.gov"},{"title":"TeamOps Statements - Service Level Agreement (SLA)","url":"/hub/team-ops/statements/sla/","tags":[],"body":"TeamOps Statements - Service Level Agreement (SLA) ** TEMPLATE ** 18F is a new digital services delivery team located within the General Services Administration.

Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) - we conduct our own PRAs and have a close working relationship with OIRA/OMB. 18F strongly recommends the use of the AWS E/W for all net-new system development, unless you require compliance with International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). There are multiple value-added components within AWS E/W that are unavailable in the AWS GovCloud; many of these directly help with the auditability and security of the system. AWS E/W services are also available at a lower rate than those in the AWS GovCloud. Uptime 18F inherits the uptime numbers in the AWS Service Level Agreement (SLA). You can find the SLA of some of the most common AWS components online: EC2 S3 RDS At the application level, 18F strives for 99% uptime. We don't yet have any historical data substantiating our application level uptime, since we're a new team. Any outage at the application level will result in a notification to you within 24 hours, with an explanation of the outage and remediation steps within seven (7) business days. DevOps For software that we develop, procure, or operate at 18F, our DevOps team will provide continuous: configuration management - we use Chef or Puppet, and Cloudformation to represent our infrastructure as code (IaC). Ensuring your entire system as IaC ensures a high degree of repeatability, auditability, and security. Just like all of our code, we check our IaC into a distributed version control system (DVCS) using git. monitoring - we use Cloudtrail and Splunk integration and deployment - we use Capistrano and Jenkins incident response - if there is an incident on your systems, we will contact your Technical Lead within 24 hours or as soon as any immediate threat is resolved. We work closely and monitor alerts from US-CERT and the open source community more broadly. Concept of Operations The 18F DevOps team manages the AWS infrastructure, in direct collaboration and consultation with our senior application developers and the GSA Security Engineering team. The root user is Noah Kunin, 18F's Delivery Architect (noah.kunin@gsa.gov). Administrative users (with almost all the powers of the root user) are limited to users trained on AWS. All users, regardless of their permission levels, must sign into the platform using a password of [insert entropy here] and using 2-factor authentication (2FA). Firewalls and overall data flow through the system are maintained by the usage of security groups. Each resource in AWS is limited by a pure whitelist - an 18F administrator must specifically enumerate ports. Each system developed by 18F receives its own internet gateway and virtual private cloud (VPC) to logically separate it from other systems in the environment. Identity access management is mediated through permission policies written in JSON. SSH Key-pairs are then assigned to appropriate users. Key-pairs are only ever stored in a GSA enclave or locally on staff laptops. The security group policy on the VPC or specific instance then limits SSH access to a GSA CIDR block, or other known and trusted entities based on system design or functionality. 18F works hard to ensure every component of our applications, and as much of our IaaS as possible, is based on free and open source (FOSS) technologies and we have the strongest FOSS policy in the Federal community to back it up. We always evaluate open source solutions first. If you choose not to use 18F's IaaS in the future, the vast majority of the system should be able to be transferred without any need to purchase licenses or negotiate intellectual property rights. 18F will provide you a comprehensive system architecture diagram before your system moves into production, noting where non-open source components are used. Shared responsibility In cases where you have engineers, developers, or other users who wish to share the responsibility of the system with 18F, we are able to provision your users if they meet the above standards. Depending on the nature of the responsibility, your users would have \"administrative-like\" permissions but only to VPCs that pertain to your systems. These users must go through the same training as 18F staff, regardless of their expertise with AWS or any other infrastructure. Experience with Linux, preferably Debian/Ubuntu but RedHat Enterprise Linux or CentOS is acceptable, is also required for access. Domain Name Service (DNS) 18F leverages AWS' world-class DNS solution, Route53, to load balance your application and provide an unparalleled level of availability, disaster recovery, and overall system flexibility. DNS services are only available if 18F is hosting your system. If you require a: second-level domain (example.gov): 18F will work with the Federal CIO, OMB, and the DotGov.gov team (located at GSA) on your behalf to get the necessary permissions to launch. third-level domain (example.youragencyhere.gov): 18F will work with your Network team to establish a CNAME record (an alias) from the desired URL to the 18F AWS infrastructure. This is usually achieved by your Network team adding a CNAME record for the URL to the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the primary Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) on your system. You can also fully delegate control over the third-level domain over to 18F. fourth-level domains and above: 18F does not recommend the use of publicly accessible domains beyond the third-level. They are difficult to type for users and difficult to use in marketing and communications. If you think you have a discrete need for a fourth-level or higher domain, please contact 18F as soon as possible, so we can first look at re-architecting your system. Fourth-level and higher domains are appropriate for non-production environments (ex: staging.example.youragencyhere.gov) IPv6 OMB [TBD] requires all Federal agencies to deploy only IPv6 compliant systems. While 18F and GSA fully concurs with this goal, currently AWS does not support IPv6 for Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) in VPCs. We posit the operational performance and security gains achieved by this best practice architecture outweigh the IPv6 compliance need. This is one area where OMB's \"cloud first\" initiatives directly contradict other guidance. The main purpose of the IPv6 policy is to ensure Federal operations are not disrupted by an eventual exhaustion of IPv4 addresses. AWS has been very proactive in obtaining IPv4 blocks for its customers and we do not anticipate any disruption of operations. ELBs are themselves a single IP that sits atop a pool of private instances - the ELB itself is an abstraction that does not provide a \"true\" IPv4 address, but instead is a FQDN that dynamically represents the pool of private instances. 18F always pre-reserves an address for its ELBs, so long before we enter production, we know if there will be an issue. At the same time, many of our Federal partners, (inclusive of GSA itself) does not have IPv6 compatible network systems, making it impossible to successfully test IPv6 functionality within the networks we operate. So even if IPv6 capabilities were deployed tomorrow, we would be reticent to make commitments to a feature we ourselves cannot test. AWS is planning on deploying IPv6 capabilities to VPC ELBs in the future and long before the IPv4 exhaustion impacts AWS customers such as 18F. We hope GSA and our partners have fully enabled internal and external IPv6 networks by that point. 18F Current Clients The following agencies are already hosting development or production systems with 18F: (USCIS) at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Department of Education (DoED) General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Elections Commission (FEC) Department of Justice (DoJ) Contact information General inquiries: 18F@gsa.gov DevOps: devops@gsa.gov Interagency Agreements: aaron.snow@gsa.gov [insert project here] Project Lead: [insert lead here] [insert project here] Technical Lead: [insert lead here]"},{"title":"Telework Policy Supplement: TeamOps","url":"/hub/team-ops/telework-policy-supplement-for-team-ops/","tags":[],"body":"Telework Policy Supplement: TeamOps In adhering to the intent of the GSA Mobility and Telework Policy, and broader 18F telework policy, 18F TeamOps employees may be allowed up to four (4) telework days per pay period, i.e. two (2) days per week.
