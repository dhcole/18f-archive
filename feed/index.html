        <description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="/assets/blog/speaker-series/cfpb-talk.jpg" alt="Mollie Bates and Natalia Fitzgerald give a talk at 18F about the design team at the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau"></p>

<p>Building a high-performing design team is tough under the best of
circumstances. Add in governmental regulations, a distributed workforce,
and rapid growth of the parent organization, and the process is even
tougher — a difficulty Mollie Bates and Natalia Fitzgerald are very
familiar with.</p>

<p>Bates and Fitzgerald helped build the design team at the <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/">Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau</a> (CFPB),
whose goal is to help consumers reclaim control over their financial
well-being by providing educational materials, improving the
accessibility of financial data, collecting and responding to consumer
complaints, and enforcing regulations.</p>

<p>“It didn’t happen overnight,” Bates said of the team’s growth, and the
process definitely presented challenges. By staying flexible and
creative, CFPB has grown a team of more than 70 designers and developers
(of roughly 1,600 total employees). Having a team of this size allows
CFPB to do more in-house design and development than most federal
agencies.</p>

<p><iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EXP1DHH2GrI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p><em>How</em> the team grew was the subject of a presentation Bates and
Fitzgerald gave at 18F on Tuesday, Sept. 22. Starting with an overview
of the CFPB’s seven core functions and a brief history of the
independent bureau within the Federal Reserve System, the two shifted to
a discussion of the four tactics employed to bring together the team
that exists today.</p>

<p>How did the team get to where it is today?</p>

<h2 id="build-a-diverse-team-of-creatives">Build a diverse team of creatives</h2>

<p>Assembling a group of driven, hardworking, creative folks seems the
obvious first step in creating a design team, but there’s more to it
than that. Early on, CFPB&#39;s design team featured predominantly
generalists, and gradually grew to include more specialists. As the team
grew, Bates and Fitzgerald made careful observations on the types of
people who flourished in the CFPB environment.</p>

<p>The most successful CFPB designers are those who are “pragmatic,
collaborative, team-driven, empathetic, and diplomatic (in other words,
really patient and flexible),” Bates said. She added, “Of course,
everyone here is really driven by our mission.”</p>

<h2 id="embrace-and-cultivate-team-culture">Embrace and cultivate team culture</h2>

<p>The CFPB design team is both distributed and comprised of smaller
project teams — two factors that could lead to siloed work. To help
designers break out of their bubbles and stay as open and collaborative
as possible, the team promotes the following four values:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Iteration</strong> — Agile doesn’t always cater to designers, but the team has found a way to align the design team’s work with that of the developers and UX designers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Communication</strong> — The team uses various tools to facilitate remote hangouts and chats, and holds weekly small-group critique sessions to share feedback.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Collaboration</strong> — To nurture the bonds among team members, the whole team gathers a few times a year to work together in person.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Transparency</strong> — The folks at CFPB promote transparency by designing and developing in the open whenever they can. Leadership embraces transparency by being open with meeting notes and organizational information.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="establish-core-standards">Establish core standards</h2>

<p>Establishing design standards helps your users more quickly familiarize
themselves with your brand (and its unique internal logic), but it also
helps your team members. Early on, the design team acknowledged that
developing and crystallizing CFPB’s brand standards would improve
designers’ efficiency.</p>

<p>“There’s no need to reinvent the wheel with each new project,”
Fitzgerald explained. Templates enable designers to work more
efficiently and focus on what really matters: doing mission-oriented
work.</p>

<h2 id="expand-and-maximize-your-reach">Expand and maximize your reach</h2>

<p>Finally, designers at CFPB work to expand and maximize their
organization’s reach. How does this play out on a practical level? At
CFPB, it involves creating opportunities for new work, working well with
design partners and colleagues, and designing for all users.</p>

<p>CFPB encourages designers to take on small projects, which could turn
into something much larger, and to serve as stewards of good design. “We
have the opportunity to serve as a resource of design expertise,”
Fitzgerald said, “and to practice design diplomacy in each project.”</p>

<p>Perhaps the most notable way the team maximizes its reach is by creating
products that serve as broad an audience as possible. CFPB has an
in-house 508 accessibility expert, and the team actively seeks ways to
make its products even more accessible. They write using plain language
(and provide content in multiple languages), and do extensive testing to
ensure products’ functionality.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p><em>This project was a collaboration between 18F and the U.S. Digital
Service (USDS). The team was lead by Mollie Ruskin (USDS) and Julia Elman (18F) and made up of
designers and developers in both groups, including Maya Benari (18F),
Carolyn Dew (18F), Victor Garcia (USDS), Angel
Kittiyachavalit (USDS), Colin MacArthur (18F), and Marco Segreto (18F).</em></p>

<p>Joanne is a young Army Veteran who is looking to make use of her GI Bill
Benefits and apply for federal student loans to attend college.</p>

<p>In trying to access the federal programs which will allow her to afford
college, Joanne must navigate the websites of multiple agencies. She
finds dozens of government websites which all seem relevant to what
she’s looking for. Joanne is confused. Are these programs related to
each other? Are they even all a part of the federal government? Are any
of these a scam? When she tries to access the sites on the bus on her
commute to work, she finds half of them are impossible to use on her
phone. She’s overwhelmed by how hard these tools are to use, misses
opportunities she’s eligible for, and feels frustrated and isolated.</p>

<p>Joanne is not alone. When the American people go online to access
government services, they’re often met with confusing navigation
systems, a cacophony of visual brands, and inconsistent interaction
patterns.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/web-design-standards/buttons.png" alt="A collection of buttons from government websites with many different colors and styles.">
<em>Each button, a special snowflake. A snapshot of a quick survey of buttons across government websites.</em></p>

<p>Dedicated federal workers are striving to build helpful digital tools
for people like Joanne. But our work happens in silos, under unique
brands and programs. As a result, we spend a lot of time “reinventing
the wheel” — recreating common patterns such as buttons, forms, and
search bars — over and over again. At the end of the day, we’re creating
poor user experiences, and wasting American taxpayer dollars in solving
the same problems again and again.</p>

<p>Taking after a growing trend in the private sector, several federal
agencies have begun creating design patterns and user interface (UI)
toolkits to build unity within their own digital brand. Some shining
examples include those of the <a href="https://cfpb.github.io/design-manual/">Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau</a> (CFPB), <a href="http://uspto.github.io/designpatterns/">US Patent and
Trademark Office</a> (USPTO), and
<a href="http://styleguide.healthcare.gov/">Healthcare.gov</a>.</p>

<p>This is a time-intensive endeavor, and not all agencies have the
resources to support it. To best serve users like Joanne, we need to set
a new bar for simplicity and consistency <strong>across</strong> government services,
not just within a given agency or program.</p>

<p>The question in front of us became: Is it possible to create a shared
set of tools to provide consistent, beautiful, and easy-to-use
government websites?</p>

<h2 id="what-we-built">What we built</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/web-design-standards/home.png" alt="A screenshot of the U.S. Web Design Standards on a desktop, tablet,
and mobile device.">
<em>The U.S. Web Design Standards are designed to be viewed on any
device.</em></p>

<p>The <a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards">U.S. Web Design
Standards</a>
are the U.S. government’s very own set of common UI components and visual
styles for websites. It’s a resource designed to make things easier for
government designers and developers, while raising the bar on what the
American people can expect from their digital experiences.</p>

<p>In the Web Design Standards, you will find:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>A visual style guide</strong>: Typography and color recommendations that are 508 compliant, flexible, and designed for readability and impact.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Common UI components and patterns</strong>: A collection of foundational interface elements for government sites and the code that powers them.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In creating these tools, we set out to accomplish four goals:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Make the best thing, the easiest thing.</strong> We believe that making tools that align with the values and needs of digital workers in the federal government will drive adoption.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be accessible out of the box.</strong> We created tools that seamlessly meet the standards of 508 accessibility, from colors to code.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Design for flexibility.</strong> We aim to give the American people a sense of familiarity when using government services, while allowing agencies to customize these tools to fit their unique needs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reuse, reuse, reuse.</strong> We reviewed, tested, evaluated, and repurposed existing patterns, code, and designs from dozens of government and private sector style guides to make use of tried-and-true best practices.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-process">The process</h2>

<p>What began as an idea turned into four months of rapid
development and iteration by a collaborative team at 18F and the U.S.
Digital Service, under the guidance of an advisory board of talented,
experienced government workers in the CFPB, the Food and Drug
Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Social Security
Administration, the Department of Education, the Internal Revenue
Service, and the GSA.</p>

<p>As with all 18F and U.S. Digital Service projects, we’re working in the
open to create a resource that everyone can own and contribute to. We’ve
taken an iterative, user-centered approach to ensure we’re addressing the
needs of our users as well as government designers and developers. A
cross-functional team of UX, front-end, and visual designers each played
a key role in this process:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/web-design-standards/wireframe.png" alt="An early wireframe of our design suggestion for a reset password
page.">
<em>An early wireframe of our design suggestion for a reset
password page</em></p>

<h3 id="user-experience">User Experience</h3>

<p>“Making the best thing the easiest thing” starts with making the
standards website itself easy to use. With every iteration of this
product, we conducted numerous interviews, usability tests, and card
sorts with designers and developers across government. Everything from
the site’s organization scheme to its code snippets and download buttons
are informed by user research.</p>

<p>The design of every component follows data-informed best practices,
found both inside (<a href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/">DigitalGov</a>) and
outside (Nielsen Norman group articles) of government. Many components
were derived from other agency and style guide patterns; more complex
patterns were further tested with end users.</p>

<p>We believe agencies should still usability test everything they build,
but following the standards will help everyone avoid common pitfalls.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/web-design-standards/code.png" alt="A sample of code from the Web Design Standards.">
<em>All of our standards include code samples.</em></p>

<h3 id="front-end">Front-end</h3>

<p>We wanted to create a single reference point for developers in need of
common patterns, providing the building blocks of code for teams to
assemble websites. Our goal was to build a system of components shaped
by modern best practices in front-end development and government
accessibility standards.</p>

<p>We built the UI components on a solid HTML foundation, progressively
enhanced to provide core experiences across browsers. All of the code is
508 compliant, so it’s accessible to everyone. Our styles are written
with Sass and can be used as a Sass library or included directly as
compiled CSS. In order to make sure our code was easy to read and easy
to pick up, it had to look like it was written from a single voice.
After speaking with dozens of front-end developers and designers in
government, we sought to strike a balance between modular CSS and code
that’s clean and easy-to-use.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/web-design-standards/colors.png" alt="A screenshot of the color section of the Design Standards.">
<em>The Design Standards include an extensive color palette.</em></p>

<h3 id="visual-design">Visual design</h3>

<p>We set out to create a single common visual style to apply flexibly on a
broad range of government platforms. We wanted a clean, modern aesthetic
that communicates credibility, trust, and warmth and meets high
standards of visual accessibility.</p>

<p>We conducted a branding exercise, auditing dozens of government
websites, logos, and brand styles. We tested dozens of typefaces, with a
laser focus on open source and highly-legible pairings. The font suite
we selected — a sturdy serif and slender sans serif — meet a range of
layout needs, from polished marketing pages to content-heavy digital
services. We landed on a palette of blue, gray, white, and red that can
be applied generously or sparingly to create a distinctly American
flavor with adaptability baked in.</p>

<h2 id="we’re-just-getting-started...and-we-need-you!">We’re just getting started...and we need you!</h2>

<p>Like any true alpha, this is a living product; we will continue to test
our decisions and assumptions with real-world feedback as it develops and evolves. We encourage you to explore the <a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards">U.S. Web Design Standards</a>, contribute your own code
and ideas, and leave feedback on <a href="https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards">GitHub</a>. We will use
your input to improve the standards and make regular releases in the
coming weeks and months.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>This project was a major feat of collaboration. We’d probably still be
off in a corner designing buttons if it hadn’t been for the
encouragement, feedback, and support of this incredible group of people
both inside and outside of government.</em></p>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="/assets/blog/speaker-series/cfpb-speakers.jpg" alt="Consumer Financial Protection Bureau designers Mollie Bates and Natalia Fitzgerald"></p>

<p>Designers Mollie Bates and Natalia Fitzgerald are intimately acquainted
with the ins and outs of consumer finance. Not only did the two
personally feel the effects of the 2008 market crash, but both helped
build the design team at the <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/">Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau</a> (CFPB),
an organization &quot;devoted to empowering consumers to take more control over their economic lives&quot; through leadership, education, and enforcement of regulations.</p>

<p>Bates and Fitzgerald will be speaking tomorrow at 18F on their
experience building the design team at the CFPB, as well as more
generally on their approaches to user-centered design. In anticipation
of this event, we sat down with them (in a metaphorical sense) to chat.
Below are the results of our email-based conversation.</p>

<p><em>Note: This interview has been edited for clarity.</em></p>

<p><strong>18F: Before starting with CFPB, what was your take on the average
American’s knowledge of consumer finance? What did you identify as the
biggest problem regarding transparency and communication of consumer
finance data, and how did your views change once you began working at
the CFPB?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Mollie Bates</strong>: Before starting at CFPB, I think I had just a vague
understanding of the cascading problems in our economy created by people
not fully understanding the terms and risks of their mortgages. I don’t
think I had any awareness of the average American’s knowledge of
consumer finance; I was only familiar with my own struggles to read the
fine print on a credit card contract or calculate the impacts of
interest on my budget. Now that I work at the CFPB, I have a much
broader understanding of the variety and complexity of consumer
financial products that consumers often deal with, from mortgages and
student loans to prepaid cards and debt collection. The terms and risks
of these products are so complicated; as designers, we often play the
“average American” role on the team when we’re working with lawyers and
economists. If we don’t understand it and can’t simply explain it to
others, we know our audience won’t get it either.</p>

<p><strong>Natalia Fitzgerald</strong>: I was living in Chicago in September 2008 when
the bottom dropped out of the market. Prior to the market collapse, I
didn’t consider the average American’s knowledge of consumer finance.
But, I imagine that my experiences mirrored those of other Americans. I
can still recall my feelings of financial uncertainty and vulnerability.
Despite all attempts at frugality and budgeting on my part, I couldn’t
get around the fact that I had mandatory monthly expenses to pay: rent,
car payment, student loans, utilities, food and credit cards. To add to
the feeling of instability, there were ongoing budget reductions at my
job, which meant that, on some days, I would clock in only to find that
certain co-workers were gone — laid off discreetly in order to balance
the budget. It was a tense time.</p>

<p>Shortly after the Bureau’s first birthday in July of 2012, I joined the
design team at the CFPB. At that time, the team was a hardworking and
dedicated unit of fewer than ten people. I didn’t know it yet, but I
would spend the next two years building a robust in-house graphic design
team within the agency.</p>

<p>Three years in, I still feel committed to our mission of transforming
the financial landscape by empowering consumers with well-designed,
user-centered tools and resources. Armed with impartial information,
data, and an avenue for filing complaints, the American people now have
a voice within the financial marketplace.</p>

<p><strong>18F: What’s the biggest government-specific design challenge you’ve
faced to date, and how did you address it?</strong></p>

<p><strong>MB</strong>: I think that corporate America already understands the
bottom-line value of incorporating design into communication, marketing,
and products. Government is playing catch-up, and that’s the biggest
challenge I see. We are working hard to build relationships across the
Bureau so that everyone has a positive experience working with our team
and asks their colleague <em>“Has the design team looked at that?”</em> before
we release a report, chart, or something else to the public.</p>

<p><strong>NF</strong>: As a government agency, we are required by law to comply with
Section 508, which dictates that federal agencies make their electronic
and information technology fully accessible to all audiences, including
people with disabilities. Accessibility for all Americans has always
been at the core of our mission as an organization, but this year we
have strived to move toward a stricter adherence to the Web Content
Accessibility Guideline (WCAG) 2.0. The guidelines are extensive and
there are many details to consider and work through. To add a level of
complexity, the guidelines were last updated in 2008, so a lot has
changed in terms of technology and the way web content is viewed. In the
absence of updated guidelines, we are charged with filling in the gaps
that exist and working to adhere not just to the specifications of the
law, but also to the spirit of the law. In working through this
challenge, we must carefully consider the diverse needs of our users.
We’re definitely becoming better designers as a result.</p>

<p><strong>18F: What strategies do you use to improve communication within your
own design team?</strong></p>

<p><strong>MB</strong>: More than half of our design and development team members work
from their homes around the country, so we value asynchronous,
transparent communication. We use GitHub issue threads to iterate on
design projects and build our design standards. (You can snoop on, or
join, our discussions on our <a href="https://github.com/cfpb/design-manual/issues">Design Manual
repo</a>.) We also have
three cross-project design pods that meet weekly for an hour of peer
critique, and then we meet as a full team each Friday to show progress
on projects. Our critique technique has changed as our team has grown,
and we’re always striving to find a replacement for the irreplaceable
“hang it on a wall and discuss in person”-style of critique.</p>

<p><strong>NF</strong>: We face a lot of communications obstacles stemming from the
separation of our large team into smaller self-sustaining project teams,
a substantial remote workforce, and a diversity of projects that are
progressing all at once. As designers, it is our responsibility to
ensure that the work we produce is consistent and clear. So, it’s
especially important that we avoid working in silos and that we keep up
with the work that other teams are producing.</p>

<p>Although we don’t all work side-by-side, we have developed a rich
culture of sharing and collaboration. This has taken many forms over the
years, from graphic design critiques, to brand development meetings, to
asynchronous feedback using GitHub. More recently, we set up a system of
cross-project critique sessions. In order to encourage
cross-pollination, we mixed up the groupings so that a single member
from each project team is represented. Breaking people out of their
project teams and maintaining a continuous conversation about the work
as it develops has improved our team culture and knocked down walls that
previously existed.</p>

<p><strong>18F: Finally, what piece of advice would you offer a new designer?</strong></p>

<p><strong>MB</strong>: Start working full-time with a group of designers that can help
you grow and learn. You can only learn what you like and what your
strengths are by working, so don’t fret over getting the perfect job!</p>

<p><strong>NF</strong>: My advice? Learn the fundamentals. When I was a new designer I
felt pressure to keep up with the latest trends in graphic design. I now
know that effective design is all about the fundamentals and there’s
nothing trendy about that. The fundamentals today — balance,
composition, spacing, typography and hierarchy — are the same as they
were one hundred years ago. In a world of rapidly changing technology,
the fundamentals remain constant. Learn them now and they will serve you
for your entire career.</p>

<p>A big thanks to Mollie and Natalia for taking the time to share their
stories with us. To learn more about Mollie and Natalia’s experience
shaping the design team at CFPB and to hear more of their insights into
the design process, tune in to the livestream of their talk, which will
air on Sept. 22 at 3:30 p.m. ET. We’ll tweet the link just before the
event starts, so follow <a href="https://twitter.com/18F">@18F</a> if you haven’t

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>For many people, September conjures up happy memories of heading back to
school, new backpack and supplies in tow. For new and aspiring citizens,
September has additional significance: It’s when the federal government
celebrates <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/news/news-releases/uscis-welcome-more-36000-citizens-during-annual-constitution-day-and-citizenship-day-celebrations">Constitution
Week</a>,
a weeklong observance commemorating the adoption of the <a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution.html">U.S.
Constitution</a>.</p>

<p>Observed Sept. 17–23, Constitution Week is a time devoted to promoting
the study of our nation’s supreme law and recognizing new citizens.
Sept. 17 marked Constitution Day and Citizenship Day, which provides a
time for folks to reflect on the rights and responsibilities that come
along with U.S. citizenship. It’s also a great time for aspiring
citizens to learn more about the naturalization process.</p>

<p>To help promote Constitution Week, we teamed up with the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/">U.S.
Citizenship and Immigration Services</a> (USCIS) to
create new resources to complement existing citizenship-focused content
as part of a national, multilingual <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/organizations/citizenship-public-education-and-awareness-campaign">public awareness
campaign</a>
that launched this summer. Since
last year, 18F has been working with USCIS to develop
<a href="https://my.uscis.gov/">my.uscis.gov</a>, a customer-facing site to help
users navigate their relationship with the agency. The team included
contractors, USCIS, and 18F employees. The resources that were just
announced are only the most recent effort we’ve undertaken together.</p>

<p>Without further ado, here’s a quick rundown of the new and updated
resources just announced by USCIS.</p>

<h2 id="a-new-page-with-general-information-about-naturalization">A new page with general information about naturalization</h2>

<p>One of the main insights we took away from our user interviews is that
USCIS customers would like more high-level information about the
naturalization process: What it involves, how long it takes, what
expectations USCIS has of the customer, and so on.</p>

<p>Our goal was to provide a single, easy-to-read reference for customers
who are still deciding whether to apply for citizenship. It was our hope
that, by seeing the steps of the naturalization process outlined,
aspiring citizens might feel more optimistic about the process and more
quickly get started with their applications.</p>

<p>To meet this user need, we created a <a href="https://my.uscis.gov/citizenship/what_to_expect">What to
expect</a> page. Using
clear, straightforward language, the page describes the main steps in
the naturalization process, offering customers a comprehensive view of
what they’re about to get into.</p>

<h2 id="a-new-page-that-better-communicates-the-rights-and-responsibilities-of-citizenship">A new page that better communicates the rights and responsibilities of citizenship</h2>

<p>Another of our goals was to provide USCIS customers with a quick
reference to the rights and responsibilities of U.S. citizens. <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/citizenship">The
Citizenship Resource Center</a>
(CRC) already provides some great
in-depth materials, and we drew on these as we built out a <a href="https://my.uscis.gov/citizenship/information">new
marketing page</a>.</p>

<p>If the CRC’s goal is to provide a comprehensive account of all the
rights and responsibilities new citizens should know about, our goal was
to translate that information into a fun, engaging page that would
capture new customers’ attention. Our new, highly visual page links out
to the existing CRC resources, making it easy for customers to quickly
access more detailed information.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/citizenshipweek/rights-and-responsibilities.jpg" alt="A screenshot of part of the new USCIS rights and responsibilities page"></p>

<p><em>The new USCIS rights and responsibilities page.</em></p>

<h2 id="more-study-resources-for-the-civics-test">More study resources for the civics test</h2>

<p>If you’re not familiar with the naturalization process, you might not
know that all would-be citizens are required to take a civics test as
part of their application process. The test covers basics of U.S.
history and government, and some of the questions can be difficult for
test takers who haven’t spent time preparing.</p>

<p>To help customers hone their civics knowledge, the CRC provides
<a href="https://my.uscis.gov/prep/test/civics">practice civics tests</a> in
multiple formats and languages. These practice exams feature questions
from the actual test; customers who study using these practice exams
tend to perform better on the actual exam than those who don’t.</p>

<p>Our updates to the practice test make it even easier for customers to
boost their civics knowledge. Some of these updates include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Clearer, more concise questions — we rewrote as much material as possible in plain language.</p></li>
<li><p>Personalization — we now refer to the customer as “you,” which we hope mimics actual, face-to-face conversation.</p></li>
<li><p>More and higher-quality images to accompany the test questions to help visual learners solidify their knowledge.</p></li>
<li><p>An audio component that allows customers to hear recordings of all the test questions.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We built and tested these (and all other) features for mobile, so
customers can practice the civics test whenever it’s most convenient for
them — when they’re waiting in line, on the bus, on lunch break, or
during other spans of spare time. And we’ll continue collecting user
feedback as we develop new features, too, to ensure we’re best meeting
our customers’ needs.</p>

<h2 id="english-or-citizenship-prep-class-locator">English or citizenship prep class locator</h2>

<p>Last but not least, we introduced <a href="https://my.uscis.gov/findaclass">a new
tool</a> that will help customers find
community-based English as a Second Language (ESL) resources. Just as
aspiring citizens need to take a civics test, they also have to pass a
brief English test to demonstrate their knowledge.</p>

<p>The class locator makes it easy for customers to find ESL classes and
study groups near them. What’s more, the tool distinguishes between
accredited and non-accredited classes, allowing customers to make the
most informed decision possible. Customers can also use the locator to
find nearby citizenship preparation classes, which will help them
navigate the naturalization process.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/citizenshipweek/classes.jpg" alt="A map of English and citizenship classes"></p>

<p><em>The English and citizenship preparation class locator provides location and
contact information.</em></p>

<p>Although participation in ESL classes is by no means required, many
customers take the classes regardless. They’re a great way to practice
conversational English, meet fellow aspiring citizens, and get involved
in the community. Our hope is that, by making it easier for folks to
find these classes, we’re encouraging increased community participation
and inspiring more civic pride.</p>

<h2 id="there’s-more-to-come">There’s more to come</h2>

<p>We’re really excited to announce these new resources, and we’re just as
excited for what’s to come. In all of our undertakings with USCIS, our
goal is to create tools, features, and content that’s as informative as
it is engaging, and that’s accessible to the broadest possible customer
base. To achieve this goal, we’ll keep interviewing customers and using
their feedback to help us help them.</p>

        <category>federalist</category>
        <guid isPermaLink="false">/2015/09/15/federalist-platform-launch</guid>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="/assets/blog/federalist/sbst-screenshot-2.jpg" alt="The new White House Social and Behavioral Sciences Team homepage"></p>

<p>Today, the White House Social and Behavioral Sciences Team (SBST)
<a href="https://sbst.gov/">launched their new website</a>.</p>

<p>What may not be apparent from looking at SBST&#39;s site is that it was
built using 18F’s new <a href="https://federalist.18f.gov">Federalist
platform</a> (currently in alpha release), a
suite of tools designed to make it faster and cheaper for government
agencies to build websites that are secure, responsive, and accessible.</p>

<p>You can think of Federalist as the glue that ties a lot of
already-existing platforms together. Federalist automates common tasks
for integrating GitHub, a content editor, and Amazon Web Services,
providing a simple way for developers to launch new websites or more
easily manage existing ones. (The platform also supports Microsoft&#39;s
Azure through open source contributions.)</p>

<p>18F developed Federalist for two audiences: federal developers who need a platform for
reliable, quick hosting of static sites, and federal groups that may not
have a developer on staff but need secure, accessible, and responsive
websites to get their content out to the public.</p>

<p>Federalist users will be able to create new sites from a suite of
well-designed templates and won&#39;t need any technical knowledge to edit
their pages. The platform includes a content editor designed for simple,
Section 508-compliant content creation, and eliminates the need for
expensive development and design efforts.</p>

<p>&quot;Federalist provides a way for people who are creating this information
to get it out to the public quickly and easily, and edit it when they
need to,&quot; says Gail Swanson, the lead researcher and designer on the
project. &quot;It allows them to build a site that is accessible for people
on mobile, 508 compliant, and secure.&quot;</p>

<h2 id="simple-and-compliant">Simple and compliant</h2>

<p>Federalist is designed to be simple. Each site comes equipped with
templates that make it easy for content creators across the federal
government to focus on what they do best: creating content. Once the
text has been written, images uploaded, and a page published, the
outward-facing website will be fast, reliable, and easily scalable.</p>

<p>The platform uses the same scalable content delivery strategy that was
developed for NotAlone.gov and healthcare.gov and puts that power into
the hands of every federal agency that uses the platform. Over the
weekend, President Obama <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/09/14/college-scorecard-launch/">launched the College
Scorecard</a>,
which “empower[s] Americans to rate colleges based on what matters most
to them.” To meet the expectedly high demand, the College Scorecard
launched on Federalist as a static website with a custom-designed
template.</p>

<p>&quot;This is a platform that&#39;s as easy to use as posting to a social media
site, but has the flexibility and scalability that the federal
government requires to manage humongous traffic,&quot; says Swanson. &quot;If the
government needs to put out a text-heavy document, it can do that. If
there&#39;s something that has videos and illustrations, it can do that
too.&quot;</p>

<h2 id="working-with-sbst-to-build-a-better-platform">Working with SBST to build a better platform</h2>

<p>The SBST team approached our team in early June and said they wanted a
website built for mid-September. At the time, the Federalist platform
existed, but was a very simple version of the way it works today.</p>

<p>Over the past three months, we’ve worked closely with the SBST team.
Their input and feedback have been invaluable and helped inform both the
design and development of the Federalist platform. We were able to
validate what worked - and what didn’t work - with real users who tried
the platform out from its very first days. We listened to their feedback
and worked with them to refine our software to meet their content
creators’ needs. We couldn’t have asked for a better (or more patient)
partner, and we want to thank the SBST team for working with us in
real-time to build a better product.</p>

<p>Working with SBST also surfaced the need to create tools and guides that
would help users on our platform. To assist people getting started with
a new website, we made the <a href="https://pages.18f.gov/federalist-content-guide/">Federalist Content
Guide</a> for writers who
will use the platform to create departmental websites and share
information about their teams.</p>

<h2 id="why-static?">Why static?</h2>

<p>Federalist is designed for publishing static government websites.
Whereas dynamic websites generate their content every time someone
visits the page, static websites are delivered to users exactly as they
are stored on a server. Dave Cole, the lead developer on the project,
has <a href="https://developmentseed.org/blog/2012/07/27/build-cms-free-websites/">written
extensively</a>
about static sites, and how they can help make websites cheaper, faster,
and more reliable. Federalist uses features already offered in GitHub to
store and manage content.</p>

<p>&quot;Rather than building a custom CMS from scratch, Federalist puts a layer
on top of an open source platform which already has proven scalability,&quot;
says Jeremia Kimelman, a developer on the program. &quot;That&#39;s one of the
great things about this platform.&quot;</p>

<h2 id="how-to-learn-more">How to learn more</h2>

<p>If your agency or department is interested in using Federalist, we’d
love to talk to you more about the platform. Visit
<a href="https://federalist.18f.gov">https://federalist.18f.gov</a> to get
started.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p><em>Editor&#39;s note: This post was originally published on <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/09/12/under-hood-building-new-college-scorecard-students">whitehouse.gov</a> by Lisa Gelobter, the Chief Digital Service Officer at the U.S. Department of Education. 18F team members Sarah Allen, Shawn Allen, Michelle Herzfeld, and Yoz Grahame along with Noah Kunin, Ozzy Johnson, Diego Mayer-Cantu, and Holly Allen worked with Lisa and the rest of the team from the U.S. Digital Service and the Education Department to develop College Scorecard.</em></p>

<p>My niece is a smart kid. I’m biased, but I swear she is.</p>

<p>Just as I started working on the College Scorecard project as the new Chief Digital Service Officer at the Department of Education, I got a call from her — she was trying to decide where to go to school. As we were building this tool, wading through this data, and working with all the top college choice tools already in the market, I was also helping her navigate her college choice process. Where should she go? What was the best value? What is value when it comes to schools? This may be the single most important investment of her life, and even she was struggling to find clear, reliable data on critical questions.</p>

<p>So that’s why today, I’m excited to share that Department of Education is announcing new steps to help students, parents and advisers make better college choices, including:</p>

<p><strong>A new, redesigned <a href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/">College Scorecard</a>.</strong> We received direct input from students, families, and their advisers to provide the clearest, most accessible, and reliable national data on college cost, graduation, debt, and post-college earnings. This new College Scorecard can empower Americans to: rate colleges based on what matters most to them, highlight colleges that are serving students of all backgrounds well, and to focus on making a quality, affordable education within reach.</p>

<p><strong>New, <a href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/">comprehensive and updated data</a> on higher education institutions.</strong>
For the first time, the public can access the most reliable and comprehensive data on students’ outcomes at specific colleges, including former students’ earnings, graduates’ student debt, and borrowers’ repayment rates. The data is also available for various sub-groups, like first generation and Pell students. Because the data will be published through an API, researchers, policymakers, and members of the public can customize their own analysis of college performance more quickly and easily.</p>

<p><strong>Customized tools for students, with 11 organizations already using the data to launch new tools.</strong>
College search resources like <a href="http://scholarmatcher.scholarmatch.org/">ScholarMatch</a>, <a href="http://www.startclass.com/">StartClass</a> and <a href="https://collegeabacus.org/">College Abacus</a> are using this data to help students search for, compare, and develop a list of colleges that are the best choice for them and their families. <a href="http://www.payscale.com/college-roi/roi-by-income-level">PayScale</a>, which offers consumers a large salary database, will use the new data to analyze various colleges’ return-on-investment for different student groups. <a href="http://www.insidetrack.com/">InsideTrack</a>, a team of coaches and consultants working to improve student outcomes, will use the data to develop and implement effective student-centered initiatives. <a href="https://www.propublica.org/">ProPublica</a>, a non-profit investigative journalism newsroom, has built a <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/colleges/">tool</a> with the open data to help consumers make more informed decisions.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-did-it">How we did it</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/college-scorecard/college-scorecard-1.jpg" alt="A team of people look at a demo of College Scorecard">
<em>One of our many demos.</em></p>

<p>This was a truly collaborative team effort: thank you to the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/">Department of Education</a>, White House Domestic Policy Council, White House Council of Economic Advisors, Department of Treasury, Office of Management and Budget, <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a> (at GSA) and the team at the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service">U.S. Digital Service</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Here are two plays we kept in mind as we went through the process:</strong></p>

<h3 id="build-with,-not-for,-users.">Build with, not for, users.</h3>

<p>We knew what we needed to do: make people’s lives better by providing them the tools and information to make more informed choices and get the best bang for their buck. And we wondered — exactly <em>how do</em> people make choices when deciding on college?</p>

<p><strong>Instead of guessing, we decided to go out and ask them.</strong></p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/college-scorecard/college-scorecard-2.jpg" alt="An amazing guidance counselor at Anacostia High with two of his students.">
<em>An amazing guidance counselor at Anacostia High with two of his students.</em></p>

<p>Following our practice of <a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/#play1">focusing on user needs</a>, the College Scorecard team first spent time engaging directly with users at every single step in the project. Some of our favorite conversations were when we talked to high school students in Washington, D.C.’s Anacostia neighborhood and their excellent guidance counselor. He told us how he “hacks” the process to make sure every one of his students gets an acceptance letter from a college, and feels that rush of possibility.</p>

<p>We met with 38 4-H kids from across the country who were frustrated by inaccurate data on the college search tools they use to find the best agricultural programs today. We listened to a mom from Maryland explain that she shopped for schools based on the lowest annual actual cost to become a medical technician — her dream job. We even called a young woman who works as a college advisor in the Bronx, who had written a letter to the President with her ideas of how to make higher education data and tools work even better for her students. We also visited the newsrooms of data journalists to understand how they used higher education open data to report on how well schools were serving students.</p>

<p>We built on the hard work of the Department of Education; previously, they met with thousands of stakeholders from the higher education community to learn about their concerns and ideas and hopes for how we could help students and families make a more informed decision.</p>

<h3 id="be-agile.">Be agile.</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/college-scorecard/college-scorecard-3.jpg" alt="Secretary of Education Arne Duncan sees the difference between the paper prototype and the mobile-friendly version of the College Scorecard.">
<em>Secretary of Education Arne Duncan sees the difference between the paper prototype and the mobile-friendly version of the College Scorecard.</em></p>

<p>Based on this research and input from the field, we made the cheapest, fastest prototype of the College Scorecard possible. We knew it needed to be mobile-first, simple, and easy to customize. That prototype ended up being a homemade, cardboard iPhone — slips of paper with wireframes of what the tool could look like. It probably cost less than a cup of coffee to produce.</p>

<p>We also went to work with the federal government’s data from over 7,000 schools, going back 18 years. We wanted to make the data usable by software developers and data scientists, so we put it into an open API that fuels the College Scorecard website. The API allows anyone to create tools and insights that will help prospective college students make these important decisions.</p>

<p>To make sure the data worked well and was clear, we engaged with a group of software developers and data scientists to be beta users of the data. In addition to the groups mentioned above, we’re also excited to see the tools and enhancements that <a href="https://niche.com/">Niche</a>, <a href="https://www.collegegreenlight.com/">College Greenlight</a>, <a href="https://www.noodle.com/">Noodle</a>, <a href="https://tractusinsight.com/">Tractus Insight (HelloCollege)</a> and <a href="http://www.imfirst.org/">I’m First!</a> are working on — and are looking forward to what many others will be able to do with the data that’s now open and available.</p>

<h2 id="what’s-in-the-data">What’s in the data</h2>

<p>The datasets include information from the Department of Treasury on student loan repayment rates, and the IRS on post-graduation income. They encompass nearly 2,000 data points for over 7,000 schools going back 18 years. By combining new data from Department of Education and Department of Treasury with data that colleges already report on graduation rates, cost, and other descriptions about their school, the College Scorecard allows everyone to find the true value of attending college, including:</p>

<p><strong>Employment outcomes:</strong> The College Scorecard contains the first-ever comprehensive and reliable data on post-college earnings for students who attended all types of undergraduate institutions, based upon tax records. While increased earnings are only one of many reasons to go to college, many students consider their future career prospects when making an investment in their education.</p>

<p>Specifically, the new Scorecard includes:</p>

<ol>
<li>The proportion of former students earning over $25,000, which is the average earnings of high school graduates, six years after enrolling, and</li>
<li>The median earnings of students 10 years after they enroll in college.
<p></p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Student-level outcomes data:</strong> The College Scorecard publishes data from the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS), which the Department of Education has used to manage and track grants and loans since the 1990s. The data can be used to produce a variety of new institutional performance metrics including</p>

<ol>
<li>Median cumulative loan debt,</li>
<li>Repayment rate, and</li>
<li>Completion and transfer rates, all by various student sub-groups.</li>
</ol>

<p></p>

<p>The demographic data includes things you might expect, like ethnicity or gender, as well as how many students are the first generation to attend college, their family income, and whether they’re taking out student loans or grants. We should point out that the Department of Education carefully aggregated this data at a high level, and does not include anything about an individual. Rather, the focus is on reporting how well schools do for students.</p>

<p>This is just the beginning. By giving developers access to an API, even more customized tools will be created, providing students more options than ever before to find the right school for them.</p>

<h2 id="what-this-means-for-the-marketplace">What this means for the marketplace</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1&amp;v=Tpaj9Sm7i7I">Today, President Obama said</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The status quo serves some colleges and the companies that rank them just fine. But it doesn’t serve our students well — and that doesn’t serve any of us well. There are colleges dedicated to helping students of all backgrounds learn without saddling them with debt. We should hold everybody to that standard. Our economic future depends on it.”
When students have more access to information, it means they can make better financial decisions for themselves and their families.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a huge win for students, families, and the marketplace — <strong>open data like this ensures that both colleges and students are operating in a more fair, competitive, and transparent environment.</strong></p>

<p>It also means that a student like my niece now has more data than ever to help her make one of the best investments in her future — and I’m pretty excited about that.</p>

digital solutions. Recently we partnered with the Department of Labor’s
Wage and Hour Division (WHD) to run a two day “Design/Dev Agile Sprint.”</p>

<h2 id="background:-investigators-in-wage-and-hour-division">Background: Investigators in Wage and Hour Division</h2>

<p>The Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division is responsible for
enforcing a wide variety of federal labor laws, including those
requiring the minimum wage, overtime, child labor protections, and
family and medical leave laws. Over 1,000 investigators, working out of
local offices nationwide, and often literally in the field, investigate
employers to determine compliance with these laws. To gather the
information they need, they travel to a wide variety of businesses,
including farms, restaurants, hotels, retail shops, construction sites,
hospitals, and many others.</p>

<p>While conducting investigations, Labor employees often turn to the Field
Operations Handbook (what they call the FOH) for guidance. The handbook
is an operations manual that provides interpretations of the law,
procedures for conducting investigations, and general administrative
guidance. It reflects policies established through changes in
legislation, regulations, significant court decisions, and the decisions
and opinions of the WHD Administrator. The handbook is a critical tool
for WHD staff.</p>

meaningful, iterative way?</strong></p>

<h2 id="the-current-landscape:-publishing-in-the-21st-century">The current landscape: Publishing in the 21st century</h2>

<p>The handbook consists of four five-inch-thick binders containing printed
and photocopied pages. These binders are replicated and distributed
across numerous regional and local offices. The handbook also exists as
online PDFs, where each chapter or subsection is published as its own
PDF. With these two options, investigators don’t have an easy way to
quickly access and search for much-needed information that helps them
complete investigations, particularly when they’re working out in the
field.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/labor-handbook/handbook.jpg" alt="Three large binders of handbook materials"></p>

<h2 id="the-challenge:-how-to-move-this-project-forward?">The challenge: How to move this project forward?</h2>

<p>The division&#39;s modernization team wanted to bring the handbook into the
21st century by placing it online and providing robust search
capabilities. This was not a radical idea.</p>

<p>Departments across the federal government often operate under three
constraints that can make these projects a challenge:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Lack of internal design and development staff dedicated to prototype or solve problems.</p></li>
<li><p>An often arduous vendor solicitation process to hire the right team to help with such projects. (WHD is experimenting with using a <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/03/30/new-rfp-ghostwriting-service-to-improve-contract-success/">modular, agile contract strategy</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>Internal teams which may lack the time, tech literacy, or processes in place to support change. How do you support change you don’t quite understand?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>18F Consulting is already working with the division&#39;s modernization team
on a much larger effort — the incremental modernization of an aging
management and investigation system. While that was underway, we
wondered, “How might we help the division move forward with a quick win
that would demonstrate what modernization can mean in a meaningful,
iterative way?” With the guidance of Tom Giancola, a WHD investigator,
and other WHD stakeholders, we chose to build a proof of concept for
modernizing the handbook.</p>

<p>At 18F Consulting, <strong>“Prove by doing” is our motto.</strong></p>

<h2 id="the-proof-of-concept-sprint:-from-design-to-prototype-in-days,-not-months">The proof of concept sprint: From design to prototype in days, not months</h2>

<p>In this two day sprint, about eight of us gathered to:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Prove that the division could produce a user-centered, technically feasible solution in days, not months.</p></li>
<li><p>Model and invite WHD team participation in human-centered design and agile development practices.</p></li>
<li><p>Produce a living, breathing pilot or minimum viable product (MVP) that the division could test with some of their investigators as they continue to build out this solution.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="who-participated?">Who participated?</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>One designer and two developers from the 18F Consulting team</p></li>
<li><p>One product owner from the WHD modernization team</p></li>
<li><p>Three WHD Investigators who frequently use this handbook</p></li>
<li><p>Three to five representatives from the division’s communications, policy, and document management teams. They helped us understand different use cases in the process and the current state of document creation, editing, and publication.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tuesday-morning:-kick-off!">Tuesday morning: Kick off!</h2>

<p>We facilitated a two-hour kick-off meeting (sometimes called an
Inception). It got the group aligned around the problem and to agree on
a plan moving forward.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/labor-handbook/group-1.jpg" alt="The 18F and Labor team writes notes up on a large white board">
<em>Kick off (Inception)</em></p>

<p>During this Inception we:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Identified the different types of <strong>users</strong> and prioritized which ones we’d focus on for our initial proof of concept.</p></li>
<li><p>Listed the <strong>goals</strong> and <strong>non-goals</strong> of the project (non-goals are great for parking valuable points that are out of scope for the current iteration).</p></li>
<li><p>Brainstormed ideas for <strong>initial features</strong> and prioritized them based on user value and build-feasibility.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensured there were no <strong>timelines</strong> or <strong>stakeholder needs</strong> that would cause problems in the near future.</p></li>
<li><p>Explored possible <strong>risks</strong> to the success of this project. We collaboratively grouped them by themes and discussed ways to reduce the risk moving forward.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tuesday-afternoon:-start-to-build">Tuesday afternoon: Start to build</h2>

<p>The designer, developers, product owner, and investigators (our primary
users) hunkered down in a work room to make the first-ever, living,
modern digital version of the Field Operations Handbook (FOH)!</p>

<p>We created an ad hoc project board to track: Backlog, Current, In
Testing/Review, Finished. We used sticky notes to write <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story">user
stories</a> and the wall of our
workspace to place the sticky note in the correct column as it
progressed. This helped the group understand our priorities for the two
days we had and to know at any time the work in progress.</p>

<p>We used this common user story format:</p>

<p>As a __________, I want ____________, so that
_____________.</p>

<p>Examples of our user stories:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>As a Wage Hour Investigator, I want a place to view the FOH online so that I can access it. <em>(ensure a staging environment with working link)</em></p></li>
<li><p>As an investigator, I want to search the FOH, so I can find answers to my questions. (<em>make Elasticsearch work, provide good search results page)</em></p></li>
<li><p>As an investigator, I want to browse the FOH by chapter, so I can discover information by topic and adjacency. <em>(provide a good information architecture)</em></p></li>
<li><p>As an investigator, I want inline links to other references so that I can make the best use of this body of knowledge. (<em>we automatically converted certain text standards into their corresponding links for hundreds of pages of documents)</em></p></li>
<li><p>As an investigator, I want the FOH to be easy to read because past methods have been hard to read. <em>(provide good version 1 typography and design of this online resource)</em></p></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/labor-handbook/group-2.jpg" alt="Developers, investigators, and product owners work together on day 2. The project&#39;s progress boards are taped to the windows.">
<em>Day 2 of the team working out of the 18F common space. Developers on
the left. Investigators (users) and product owners talking about needs
on the right. Taped to the windows are the progress boards (Backlog,
Current, Done).</em></p>

<p>Tom, the product owner had already used optical character recognition
(OCR) software to convert 100s of PDFs into MS Word documents. Microsoft
styles and headings were applied to the content to begin to structure
the data. (Aside: this is a perfect example of using the tools you know
best to move a project forward!) With that in hand, our developer
validated the technical feasibility of converting those Word documents
to HTML pages that could be searched using Elasticsearch.</p>

<p>By the end of Tuesday we had:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>As a group understood the needs and challenges of the handbook as a larger project and scoped out what could be accomplished in a couple days</p></li>
<li><p>Demonstrated user story writing and how to use a simple agile or Kanban board</p></li>
<li><p>Within four hours, had a rough application that could search 100s of pages of documents as live HTML text. The division staff in the room thought that would take months!</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="wednesday:-build-and-design.-get-feedback.-repeat.">Wednesday: Build and design. Get feedback. Repeat.</h2>

<h3 id="build">Build</h3>

<p>Coming into the sprint, we understood that one of the major constraints
is that the handbook is created and maintained using Microsoft Word.
Minimizing the effect on workflow was therefore a key part of any
proposed technical solution. Fortunately, there are several open-source,
publicly available tools that allow for automated conversion from Word
files (.docx) into web-friendly files (.html), including
<a href="http://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a>. So, first, we wrote a
<a href="https://github.com/18F/dol-whd-foh/blob/master/src/build.js">script</a>
that uses pandoc to automatically convert the Word files to HTML files.</p>

<p>Then, to get the HTML files to be more usable, we wrote a <a href="https://github.com/18F/dol-whd-foh/blob/master/src/make.js">second
script</a>
that extracts the content from the HTML file, does some high-level
parsing, creates a Table of Contents, establishes JSON objects for each
part of the Chapter (along with associated metadata), loads the JSON
objects into an Elasticsearch service, and rewrites each HTML file to
include links to other government sources and internal links. Finally,
the files and search results were served using NGINX as the application
server (later, this was rewritten to work with Apache).</p>

<hr>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>"...we made so much progress in a short period of time! It’s searchable and you can actually read it." —Amy, Senior Advisor, Immigration and Farm Labor Branch </strong></p>

<hr>

<h3 id="design">Design</h3>

<p>One of the great things about a cross-functional team in the same room
for a sprint is you can use faster design tools. Instead of creating
pixel perfect “mockups” of how navigation might work, or how a page
might visually feel, we did quick pen sketches on paper, a rough color
scheme in Illustrator and then went right into design and developer
pairing. We discussed problems and opportunities on the spot and were
empowered to move forward with our ideas.</p>

<h3 id="feedback">Feedback</h3>

<p>Actual investigators made this sprint a success. Working with them over
the two days, we determined the best interface copy that would be clear
and actionable to their peers. Seconds after code was pushed to the
staging site, we observed how they used search and understood the search
results pages. Feedback was immediately incorporated.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/labor-handbook/foh-screenshot.jpg" alt="Screenshots of the prototype for an online version of the handbook.">
<em>Two days later we had a working prototype showing browsable chapters
and a search results page.</em></p>

<h2 id="what’s-next?">What’s next?</h2>

<p>For many of us in the design and software development profession,
building a working prototype is not a big deal. For the dedicated civil
servants in the federal government, it can be. Over these two days we
demonstrated that with the right support and the right people in the
room, ideas can be tested, iterated upon, and realized without months of
requirements gathering, large waterfall contractual agreements, and
other impediments.</p>

<p>This prototype, built over a two-day sprint, is still an internal proof
of concept for the people responsible for improving the FOH. For
important legal reasons, they are dedicated to ensuring the
confidential, internal-facing guidelines are developed in a secure, yet
accessible way. Our prototype used the public-facing portion of their
guidelines to reduce that risk. In the next few months, they will pilot
this with a few regions while they work on securing a development
environment that can house the more useful internal-facing documents
(helping government do that better is another story for another day).
Meanwhile, for all future discussions, they have a working prototype,
created with internal stakeholders in the room who helped build it!</p>

<p>18F and GSA are committed to being proactive federal partners and
providing operational excellence wherever we can. By working
hand-in-hand with the WHD team, we’ve been able to show them what’s
possible, and have given them the basic knowledge to ask the right
questions to help them develop solutions in a cost-effective,
user-centered way.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="/assets/blog/myuscis/myuscis.jpg" alt="The new myuscis homepage"></p>

<p>After the weather and taxes, immigration is one of the government services that people visit most online. Last week alone, <a href="https://analytics.usa.gov/">3.6 million
people</a> visited the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/">U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website</a> to understand the application process, check the status of their cases, and seek help. USCIS receives about 6 million petitions and applications a year — that’s more than 16,000 a day. Supporting this many users is a huge task, and USCIS knows it could do more to meet customer needs on its website.</p>

<p>I know firsthand how challenging the immigration process can be. After
our wedding last July, my husband, a British citizen who was in the United States on a
student visa, applied to adjust his status to become a permanent
resident. We thought our case would be relatively straightforward — but
instead it lasted nine months and involved more than a few sleepless
nights.</p>

<p>That’s why I’m excited about the opportunity to help create solutions to
address these challenges. Since November, I’ve been working with a team from 18F and
USCIS to develop <a href="https://my.uscis.gov/">my.uscis.gov</a>, a customer-facing site
to help users navigate their relationship with the agency. USCIS approached 18F about the partnership because they wanted to improve the experience for millions of users like my husband and me.</p>

<p>Central to the changes we’re making is focusing on the journey of the
person submitting the application rather than the life cycle of a form or process.
Currently, USCIS interacts with customers on a form-by-form basis. myUSCIS is a step in creating a unified experience for all the applications and interactions that make up that
journey.</p>

<p>We’ve spent the past year gathering the stories of many USCIS customers
in order to understand the fine details of the process that really matter to them —
the touch points that make the difference between a reassuring, happy process and a
confusing or anxious one. The features we’re building address many of these concerns
we heard from users directly.</p>

<p>Almost all of the USCIS customers we’ve talked to have told us they have
lots of questions about the application process. If they can’t easily find
answers on the current site, they turn to third-party sources for
information, which give conflicting — and sometimes incorrect —
information. On myUSCIS, users can consult a help center, which features
a growing repository of plain language answers to frequent questions.
This builds on efforts already underway within USCIS to help make forms
easier to understand.</p>

<p>Some of the most common issues we’re addressing with myUSCIS:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Users can enter their current immigration status and select what they’re trying to do. The site shows them the benefits they’re eligible for and how to apply.</p></li>
<li><p>We’re designing an online application process to replace multiple PDF forms, and are working with USCIS’ plain language experts to make it as clear as possible to do what’s required.</p></li>
<li><p>We’re designing an improved account system so users can see their notices and appointments in a single location and find out what to expect next.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>myUSCIS launched in January, and we’re testing and building new features
every day. Users can already find clearer information on
<a href="https://my.uscis.gov/">my.uscis.gov</a>. Soon, they’ll be able to apply
online and have a smoother experience, with less uncertainty. And we’re
just one part of the ecosystem. While we’re partnering with USCIS to
tackle the customer-facing side of the problem, the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/05/07/how-federal-government-modernizing-immigration-system">U.S. Digital
Service headquarters is helping</a> to modernize USCIS’s technology and make internal
processing more efficient. Together, we’re excited to be improving a
system that millions of people rely on — and hopefully brings them more
satisfaction than either a completed tax return or a sunny weather
forecast.</p>

        <guid isPermaLink="false">/2015/09/04/what-is-technical-debt</guid>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Let&#39;s assume we’re developing a software product. When we make
short-term compromises to its code or design quality, we’re making the
product more difficult for someone else to continue to develop, test,
and maintain in the future. This is the concept of technical debt
(explained more in the <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/08/07/technical-debt-1/">first part of this
series</a>), which is
similar to financial debt. For example, the extra effort required to
finish our incomplete work represents the principal portion of the debt.
And the extra time it takes to work with our unwieldy code or design,
until it’s fixed, represents the interest portion.</p>

<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="/assets/blog/technical-debt/graphic-1.jpg" alt="A bar graph showing how poor design can increase the cost of making changes or adding new features" width="400px">
</div>

<p>Like financial debt, not all technical debt is bad debt. For example,
taking out a mortgage on a home that you pay back within 15 years and
sell for a 175 percent return is good debt. Conversely, racking up a
huge credit card balance on a luxury yacht with no means to pay it back
is reckless.</p>

<p>With software, it’s perfectly reasonable to release early with known
limitations in order to capture a time-bound market opportunity or meet
a compliance deadline, as long as there’s staff in place to address
those limitations after the launch. Another great way to leverage
technical debt is to quickly run a market experiment (<em>a la</em> lean
startup). If the experiment doesn’t yield the desired results, you can
remove the feature, and not even bother repaying the debt. That would be
a waste. Of course, if you keep the feature, then it must be finished,
and you can do that with the benefit of what you learned from the
experiment. So the aim shouldn’t be to achieve a completely debt-free
product. Instead, you want a product with <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DesignStaminaHypothesis.html">whatever level of quality is
necessary to give the development team enough stamina to go faster for
longer</a>.</p>

<p>Just as you&#39;ll find in the financial world, there are different kinds of
technical debt. Martin Fowler, a leading software expert, classifies
technical debt into four types, as shown in the quadrant below.</p>

<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="/assets/blog/technical-debt/graphic-2.jpg" alt="A grid of the four types of technical debt. Reckless and deliberate, reckless and inadvertent, prudent and deliberate, prudent and inadvertent." width="600px">
</div>

<p>Here&#39;s how each type may occur:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Reckless/Deliberate Debt</strong> — The team feels time pressured, and knowingly violates best practices without any forethought into how to address the consequences. Another scenario: management lacks sufficient funding to hire enough senior experts to direct and review the work of junior programmers, but decides to take the risk anyway.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prudent/Deliberate Debt</strong> — The team decides that the value of shipping a “quick and dirty solution” <em>now</em> is worth the cost of incurring debt. They’re fully aware of the consequences, however, and have a plan in place to address them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reckless/Inadvertent</strong> — The team is ignorant of best practices, and makes a big mess of the codebase.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prudent/Inadvertent</strong> — Even with great programmers, the team delivers an extrinsically valuable solution, only to realize how they should have (intrinsically) designed it. (Often the process of software development is as much learning as it is coding.)</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-are-the-consequences-of-technical-debt?">What are the consequences of technical debt?</h2>

<p>From annoying bugs to crippled projects, the effects of technical debt
manifest in a variety of pernicious ways. Jim Highsmith’s technical debt
curve, modified below, illustrates what happens as technical debt grows
within a software product over time:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The cost (or difficulty) of change increases, eventually to the point of unmaintainability</p></li>
<li><p>The ability to respond to the needs of customers decreases, making them extremely unhappy</p></li>
<li><p>The predictability of results decreases, making management highly distrustful. (Producing accurate estimates for software with a high amount of debt is nearly impossible.)</p></li>
</ul>

<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="/assets/blog/technical-debt/graphic-3.jpg" alt="A graph showing how the cost of change increases over time when you have technical debt, and that hurts your ability to meet user needs." width="400px">
</div>

<p><em>Source: <a href="http://jimhighsmith.com/the-financial-implications-of-technical-debt/">Jim
Highsmith</a></em></p>

<p>How do projects end up on the far right of the curve? And why is that a
bad place to be? As <a href="http://jimhighsmith.com/the-financial-implications-of-technical-debt/">Highsmith
explains</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One problem with technical debt is that the impact can be slow growing
and somewhat hidden. To the question ‘Fix the technical debt, or build
new features’ we know how it is usually answered. As it gets worse
customers complain about slow delivery, increasing the pressure to
take more short cuts, which increases the technical debt, which slows
the delivery process, which increases customer dissatisfaction, in a
rapidly spiraling vicious cycle. Unfortunately, by the time many
organizations are paying attention, all the solutions are bad ones: 1)
do nothing and it gets worse, 2) re-place/re-write the software
(expensive, high risk, doesn’t address the root cause problem), or 3)
systematically invest in incremental improvement.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Customers aren’t the only ones who <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/managing-technical-debt">suffer the
consequences</a>
(annoying bugs, missing features, etc.) of technical debt:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Friendly help desk staff</strong> will field more support calls</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Software operations team</strong> loses sleep patching the system all hours of the day</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Management</strong> gets bad publicity due to bugs, delays, security issues, or outages</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Developers</strong> have to deal with the bad work of other developers, which <a href="http://www.industriallogic.com/blog/technical-debt-considered/">may cause turnover</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now that you understand what technical debt is, we’ll discuss how to
manage it in our next post.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/usinterior/20900647896/in/album-72157657833038461/"><img src="/assets/blog/every-kid-in-a-park/every-kid-in-a-park.jpg" alt="Two students hold up their Every Kid in a Park passes"></a>
<em>Students from Samuel W. Tucker Elementary School receive an Every Kid
in a Park pass. Photo credit: Department of Interior.</em></p>

<p>At first glance, the phrases “government website” and “for kids,” might
not seem to go hand in hand.</p>

<p>But the launch of Every Kid in a Park highlights how user research can
bring beautiful, useful design to federal websites — including those
aimed at children.</p>

<p>Every Kid in a Park gives U.S. fourth graders free access to all federal
lands and water — including national parks, forests, wildlife refuges,
and marine sanctuaries — for a full year. And they can bring their
families and friends with them for free, too.</p>

<p>“I can&#39;t wait for my future fourth grader to take advantage of the Every
Kid in a Park program,” said Denise Turner Roth, the head of the General
Services Administration (GSA). “As both a parent and the Administrator
of GSA, I&#39;m thrilled that we were able to use some of the innovative
skills we have at 18F to develop this kid-friendly website for the
Department of Interior.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://everykidinapark.gov">everykidinapark.gov</a>
is the landing page for that program. It includes a comprehensive list
of where kids can go, explains how the program works, and shows how to
print a pass. Best of all, it was designed, developed, and written for
10-year-olds.</p>

<p>Here at 18F, we were proud to develop the site in partnership with the
U.S. Department of Interior and other federal land management agencies.</p>

<p>“I&#39;m so proud to be part of this initiative that gets children out from
in front of their screens indoors to great, wild, and exciting
outdoors,” 18F Developer Shashank Khandelwal said. Khandelwal served as
the website’s product manager.</p>

<p>This sentiment was echoed across team members. Christine Cheung, the
site’s lead developer said it was a joy to work on such a passionate
team.</p>

<p>“As a fan and ardent visitor of national parks myself, I&#39;ve been so
happy to be involved in a project that is focused on getting the next
generation out there exploring,” Cheung said.</p>

<p>From the outset, our team knew the Interior Department made for an
exciting, forward-thinking partner. Before we got involved, they hosted
a design studio, a mini-hackathon, and three rounds of user testing with
the University of Maryland’s Kids Team.</p>

<p>They had already honed in on one product — a paper pass — that worked
for both kids and the national sites they’d be visiting. In short, our
partners were well on the way to an excellent product when we had the
opportunity to join.</p>

<p>A small group of 18F team members — including one Presidential
Innovation Fellow — were thrilled to jump in, and together we began our
work with user-centered design and plain language. We made pages, tested
them with users, and adjusted our views accordingly.</p>

<p>That testing “reminded us of the creativity that can come from young
minds,” <a href="https://presidentialinnovationfellows.gov/fellows">Presidential Innovation Fellow Chris
Goranson</a> said.</p>

<p>The resulting website was carefully crafted, from the colors and the
photos, to the text on every page. Even the information for parents and
teachers was designed to be understandable for our primary users
— fourth graders.</p>

<h2 id="building-a-site-for-kids-has-unique-challenges">Building a site for kids has unique challenges</h2>

<p>“I love to design websites for kids, especially when those sites coax
them right back offline again and encourage them to explore,” said Eric
Ronne, the site’s lead visual designer. “That helped make this project
especially meaningful for me.”</p>

<p>The website’s visual design relies on bright colors, friendly icons, and
plentiful pictures. In its first iteration, we featured bucolic
landscapes and a nightscape. But kids found the dark photo scary, and
they wanted to see more pictures of people playing and swimming. We
found more daytime photos and photos with kids in hammocks and families
exploring.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-do-when-your-audience-doesn’t-know-the-word-“federal”">What to do when your audience doesn’t know the word “federal”</h2>

<p>We also trimmed content as much as possible. Our first draft was sparse
by government standards, but students still disliked the paragraphs they
encountered. So we scaled back the text.</p>

<p>Word choice was a challenge, too. We originally called “passes”
“vouchers,” but most of our users didn’t have that word in their
vocabulary. They also didn’t know what “federal” meant. So we eliminated
it wherever we could — no easy feat on a federal website.</p>

<p>Our goal was to write the whole site — including the parents and
educators pages — at a fourth-grade level. That goal was backed by data
that showed fourth graders immediately wanted to click on the
“grown-ups” pages, to see what they contained.</p>

<p>By launch, we’d combed through every sentence, eliminating as many
complex words and phrases as possible. We even re-wrote the legal,
privacy policy to read within a fourth-grade level. One of our last
obstacles was the social media tags.</p>

<p>We wanted to feature #EveryKidInAPark prominently — so people knew how
to share their stories. We built out a standard footer that included the
official hashtag and icons for Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/everykidinapark">@everykidinapark</a>),
<a href="https://instagram.com/everykidinapark/">Instagram</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Every-Kid-in-a-Park/1433456993647993?sk=timeline">Facebook</a>.</p>

<p>But when we tested it with fourth graders? They’re too young to be on
Facebook, which bans users under 13. Many of the kids said they had
house rules against Instagram accounts. None of them used Twitter.</p>

<p>A site designed for 10-year-olds shouldn’t recommend social media they
can’t visit or don’t use. So those icons — ubiquitous in so much web
design — had to go.</p>

<h2 id="the-result">The result</h2>

<p>A huge amount of credit goes to our partners at the Interior Department.
We couldn’t have envisioned and enacted this site without their support.</p>

<p>What launched on September 1 is the first version of the site. We’re
constantly working to make updates and improvements. <a href="https://everykidinapark.gov">Check it

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>We recently began our partnership with the Office of Personnel
Management (OPM) on the <a href="http://www.fedtechmagazine.com/article/2014/10/govconnect-makes-employee-passion-projects-reality">GovConnect
initiative</a>,
which helps agencies create a culture of excellence based on
collaboration and teamwork.</p>

<p>To develop federal talent that can work and learn across boundaries, we
need new practices and technologies. GovConnect helps agencies test and
scale these approaches so we can build a 21st-century system that will
better respond to demands and handle cross-agency program and policy
challenges. It will do all this without the unnecessary limitation of
organizational silos by implementing a new model of a mobile, agile,
innovative, and skilled federal workforce. The OPM team, which includes
staff trained by the OPM Innovation Lab and Stanford’s d.school, will
develop this model in collaboration with other agencies.</p>

<p>18F signed onto this initiative to innovate the federal workforce, a
goal that complements the General Services Administration’s belief that
long-term success requires a strong, diverse, and optimized workforce.</p>

<p>We’re most well known for delivering digital services, which sometimes
leads people to believe our team is composed purely of technologists who
write code. However, some of our toughest challenges are understanding
the problems facing our agency partners and the people they seek to
positively impact. Thoroughly researching a problem can lead to new
approaches or the identification of existing solutions that can be
scaled or augmented with technology. Like OPM’s Innovation Lab, we
investigate problems with a human-centered design approach, starting
each project with a “discovery” phase to deeply understand how people
work, the challenges they face, and what their needs are.</p>

<p>The discovery phase includes a mix of face-to-face interviews, remote
collaboration, shadowing, and participatory workshops intended to engage
the user with the design problem. We do all this in collaboration with
our agency partners. Throughout discovery, design, and development, we
work to validate our assumptions by always including the people who will
use the services. We’re excited to work with OPM, which has been an
active leader of the federal “design thinking” community with their
Innovation Lab program.</p>

<p>The GovConnect initiative is a fascinating laboratory for research into
the challenges of developing and attracting talent in the federal
workforce. Our current government model was designed for a different
kind of work and predates current technology and management practices.
GovConnect is applying human-centered design methods to reframe the
experience of working and learning in the federal government.</p>

<h2 id="the-story-so-far">The story so far</h2>

<p>One goal of
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/07/08/smarter-more-innovative-government-american-people">President Obama’s second-term management agenda</a>
is to improve the effectiveness of the federal workforce - a workforce
that makes up almost 3 million civilian employees across the world.
Reaching this goal will increase employee engagement, raise
productivity, and potentially attract a new generation of public
servants.</p>

<p>Several successful initiatives provided early proof of a new
collaborative model of workforce development: <a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/join-digitalgov/open-opportunities-in-digitalgov/">Open Opportunities</a>
(developed by GSA’s Office of Citizen Services and Innovative
Technologies),
the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) <a href="http://www.fedmanager.com/news/2063-epa-professional-development">Skills
Marketplace</a>,
the White House’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/12/02/designing-citizen-science-and-crowdsourcing-toolkit-federal-government">Innovation
Toolkit</a>,
and the Department of Housing and Urban Development&#39;s <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/federal_government/engaging-new-employees-to-improve-huds-workplace-and-operations/2013/06/24/8d442838-dd20-11e2-bd83-e99e43c336ed_story.html">Innovation
Time</a>.
Each of these efforts seek to tap the passion, energy, and ingenuity of
federal employees and allow people to develop their professional skills
by tackling problems that face federal agencies.</p>

<p>Thanks to the success of these initiatives and the passion of our
partners at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), GovConnect was
born. GovConnect is an agile workforce initiative sponsored by OPM and
co-led by EPA to encourage agencies to think differently about work, one
that develops and connects the federal workforce, encourages innovation,
and helps develop critical skills and build professional networks across
the government to where and when they’re needed. GovConnect is a network
of existing and new programs that seek to achieve this goal.</p>

<h2 id="govconnect-phase-one">GovConnect phase one</h2>

<p>In April 2014, OPM&#39;s <a href="https://www.chcoc.gov/content/govconnect-expo-follow-identifying-volunteer-pilot-agencies">call for
participation</a>
led to the selection of a cohort of pilot agencies to explore activating
their own workforce through new approaches to work. Based on interviews
with existing programs, the GovConnect team identified three models:</p>

<p><strong>GovProject</strong> — Employees can develop professional skills and expertise
on a part-time basis (for example, up to 20 percent time) to support
project opportunities within the employee’s agency or in another
government agency. This model would also support the rapid deployment of
cross-agency tiger teams to respond to complex problems or
time-sensitive needs.</p>

<p><strong>GovStart</strong> — Employees can work on innovative initiatives on a
part-time basis (for example, up to 20 percent time) and develop
professional networks within and across agencies. These micro-projects
are grassroots employee driven as opposed to management driven.</p>

<p><strong>GovCloud</strong> — Employees are hired by one agency and are detailed out to
agencies on a project-by-project basis to address critical skills gaps.
GovCloud employees may work on one project at a time or work on multiple
projects at once.</p>

<p>For the past year, pilot agencies have made progress on diverse
initiatives. A GovConnect pilot does not require technology to get
started and could be as simple as a conference room with whiteboards and
sticky notes, or be driven by Google Forms and email, or include
postings on a pre-existing WordPress blog or SharePoint site.</p>

<p>In addition, some mentor programs have flourished. EPA’s Skills
Marketplace has become established within the EPA as an effective
resource for managers. Open Opportunities has grown dramatically and is
now open to all federal employees.</p>

<p>18F has developed the Midas software platform that fuels the Open
Opportunities program. We believe that many of the successful pilots
could be scaled with software and will use the research to improve the
Midas platform. However, the GovConnect primary researcher will work
separately from the Midas team and 18F is open to learning from their
research.</p>

<h2 id="what-will-18f-do?">What will 18F do?</h2>

<p>18F researchers have already started connecting with pilot mentors,
pilot agencies, and private sector and nonprofit firms. The goal of this
research is to learn what patterns of success, and failure, might exist
and what have been the growing pains of successful initiatives. Initial
research will be conducted in the form of one-on-one interviews, as well
as reviewing metrics and other research already conducted by the
GovConnect teams. By working directly with agencies who are developing
pilots, have launched successful programs, or who have run into barriers
to adoption, 18F will take a human-centered approach to developing the
next step in the GovConnect solution.</p>

<p>The outcome of this discovery phase will be the production of a Starter
Kit with proven techniques from other agencies, including non-technical,
real-world approaches as well as technical solutions that can help
programs scale.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="/assets/blog/lego-workshop/sba-execs-legos.jpg" alt="Executives from the Small Business Administration learn agile development with Legos."></p>

<p>The Small Business Administration was ready to try something different.</p>

<p>For years, the Small Business Administration (SBA), along with the rest
of the federal government, has used the waterfall product development
methodology. You’re familiar with it: start by gathering requirements,
then design the software, then code, then test, then finally release it
to the world.</p>

<p>But they started wondering, is this really the best way? Or should we be
trying something new? It turns out not even the creator of waterfall,
Dr. Winston Royce, thought waterfall was a good idea!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/lego-workshop/waterfall-quote.jpg" alt="A highlighted quote that says &quot;I believe in this concept, but the implementation described above is risky and invites failure.&quot;">
<em>From page 2 of Dr. Royce’s 1970 paper, <a href="http://www.serena.com/docs/agile/papers/Managing-The-Development-of-Large-Software-Systems.pdf">Managing the
Development of Large Software Systems</a>.</em></p>

<p>Federal agencies have been exploring agile, a product development methodology that emphasizes fast iterations and rapid feedback over extensive requirements gathering and planning, for a while. Since the
<a href="http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-12-681">Government Accountability
Office</a> studied and recommended
using agile practices in 2012, an increasing number of federal agencies
have been adopting them.</p>

<p>So the SBA was ready to try it out. They hired an agile vendor, but knew
in order to be successful they had to change how they worked, too.</p>

<p>SBA asked <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/consulting/">18F Consulting</a> to run an
“introduction to agile” workshop for their executives. They wanted the
executive team to be familiar with agile: how it worked, agile-specific
vocabulary, and why agile will help them succeed.</p>

<p>Dave Zvenyach gave an overview of the workflow of agile, how it differs
from waterfall, and defined some common agile terms like sprints,
backlogs, and user stories. The SBA executive team paid close attention,
asked some great questions, and wrote pages of notes.</p>

<p>But when it comes down to it, much like The Matrix, one can’t be told
what agile is. One must experience it for oneself. It was time for the
red pill.</p>

<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="/assets/blog/lego-workshop/red-pill.gif" alt="The red and blue pill from The Matrix">
</div>

<p>We split the group into two teams and told them that, in the next 90
minutes, they would build a product — agile style. There would be three
30-minute sprints, with demos at specific times. No matter what. We
would have a five-minute sprint planning meeting as a group, then the
teams would have 15 minutes to build, two minutes to demo, and three
minutes for retrospective. Dave and I would be the product owner and the
customer, respectively.</p>

<p>As the product owner, I gave the teams their user stories:</p>

<ul>
<li>  As an office worker, I want a laptop stand so I have more desk space.</li>
<li>  As a mobile office worker, I want my stand to be sturdy and not fragile so it doesn’t fall apart when I move it.</li>
<li>  As a marketing manager (for the product), I want an advertisement so people find out about the product and decide to buy it.</li>
</ul>

<p>And then I dumped a bucket of Lego bricks in front of each team. “Go!”</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/lego-workshop/sba-execs-legos-2.jpg" alt="SBA executives prepare to build with Legos."></p>

<p>After a few “I haven’t played with Legos in 40 years…”, they were off!</p>

<p>The first team pretty quickly called me, the product owner, over to ask
a question. “Can we see the laptop?” They measured the dimensions, the
weight, and generally took a look at what they needed to hold up.</p>

<p>After fifteen minutes, I yelled “LEGOS DOWN. SPRINT IS DONE! Time for
demos!”</p>

<p>The first team demo’d their product. It was simple, a few supports and a
platform, but it was a great first iteration. After examining it, I
announced “You have passed the acceptance tests for this user story!”</p>

<p>“Second team — time to demo!”</p>

<p>The second team got up. “We present to you… the M.O.C.C. The Mobile
Office Command Center. It’s a scaled down model of a full service desk,
made from the latest in environmentally friendly materials. It has a
swivel-out laptop stand, a lamp, drawers, is on wheels so it can be
moved around from place to place to support the new mobile office
worker.”</p>

<p>I nodded. Inhaled.</p>

<hr>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>"That’s great, team. That looks really cool. The
  thing is, I asked for a laptop stand. You guys built a desk. I already
  have a desk. If you had talked to the customer during the sprint, I
  would have told you this isn’t what I wanted."</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>And that’s when it hit them. The importance of agile. The importance of
talking to users early and often and continuously. The importance of
delivering products iteratively, instead of all at once. And more
importantly, how this approach can reduce the risk of failure, as well
as reducing the consequences of failures.</p>

<p>SBA’s executives continued to iterate on their products and learn about
the process. By the end of it, they walked out educated, excited, ready
to both work with that agile vendor, and ready to start implementing
agile methodologies in their own organizations.</p>

<h2 id="learn-more">Learn more</h2>

<p>If you or your team is interested in learning more about agile, email us
at inquiries18F@gsa.gov and let’s talk. This particular workshop was
built for executives, but we also run introductory bootcamps for front
line workers, specialized workshops for contracting officers, or deep
dives for product owners.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>In January, 18F Consulting
<a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/01/08/creating-a-federal-marketplace-for-agile-delivery-services/">announced</a>
a new kind of process for vendors to compete for software acquisition
contracts. The Agile Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) process would be
open to existing vendors on Schedule 70, and require vendors to submit a
working prototype based on a public dataset — and then show their work
in a publicly available git repository.</p>

<p>A number of decision factors led to the <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;tab=core&amp;id=e0807fc8a69115f0e352f6f0c135697a">request for
information</a>
(RFI) and then the <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/06/15/agile-bpa-is-here/">request for
quotation</a> (RFQ).
Over the last few months, the demand for 18F to build products for
agencies has been explosive. To meet this demand, we realized that we
needed help from outside vendors who work the way we do — using
techniques like agile development cycles and user-centered design
processes. We’ve also identified the need for a contract vehicle through
which agencies can gain access to a pool of vendors that work in this
way as well.</p>

<p>Our partner throughout this project has been the Federal Acquisition
Service (FAS), and before we talk about the BPA process, we want to
acknowledge how much we learned from FAS, and how grateful we are for
the time and effort they have put into this award process. Though 18F
served as the requirements owner of this effort, the <a href="http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/105150">Integrated
Technology Services</a> (ITS)
office within FAS executed the contracting work through the award phase
and the Assisted Acquisition Services (AAS) office will handle
post-award task orders and management. Throughout this process, we
worked closely with a number of people at GSA’s Southeast Sunbelt
Region, including our contracting officer and his team, to help make the
Agile BPA happen. Going forward, FAS officers in GSA’s Pacific Rim
Region will be issuing the task orders on the BPA. These awards could
not have been issued without them. We want to thank them, and are
looking forward to working with them again in the future.</p>

<p>The vendors are:</p>

<li><a href="https://github.com/dwafler/gsa_2015.git">World Wide Technology</a></li>
</ol>

<p>They represent large companies and small businesses, from all over the
country. But the unifying theme amongst them is that they delivered
amazing, working software in response to our RFQ.</p>

<p>As the first set of awards (Pool Three) are now being issued, we asked
three members of the 18F Consulting team to sit down together and share
what they’ve learned throughout the process.</p>

<p><strong>The panel:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Chris Cairns, Director, 18F Consulting</p></li>
<li><p>Dave Zvenyach, Director of Acquisition Management, 18F Consulting</p></li>
<li><p>Kathryn Edelman, Consultant, 18F Consulting</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="a-look-into-the-bpa-process">A look into the BPA process</h2>

<p><strong>You’ve been working non-stop on the Agile BPA process for the past six
months. This is the week the awards are coming out. What are you doing
this week and how do you feel?</strong></p>

<p>We’re currently moving slowly through the process to make sure we are
doing all of the right things to make this BPA good for the federal
government.</p>

<p>One thing to emphasize: while we’re incredibly excited about the award
of the Agile BPA, getting to this point is actually just the first step.
We think we were successful in demonstrating some solid innovation with
the award process, but we’ve got a long way to go now before we can
declare success on what really matters: demonstrating the ability to
partner with industry to deliver successful digital services to our
customers using agile delivery practices.</p>

<p>In other words, as with the rest of 18F, delivery is the strategy, and
now we’re looking forward to shipping under the BPA.</p>

<p><strong>What were you expecting or hoping to see from vendors after you
announced the Agile BPA process?</strong></p>

<p>We weren’t totally sure what we’d get. We knew that there was a lot of
interest, but we weren’t sure whether that would translate into
submissions. We ultimately hoped that there would be great vendors out
there who could ship solid, working software in a short amount of time.
We also hoped that vendors would be excited to show us their
capabilities rather than describe them.</p>

<p><strong>I saw many vendors working in public online. Could you point to some
examples of what you saw throughout the process?</strong></p>

<p>We were completely blown away by certain unexpected and awesome things.
We saw many independent creations of GitHub repos by vendors — and we
even saw someone who was outside the award process, who created <a href="https://github.com/LinuxBozo/18f-bpa-repos">a
repo</a> to track vendor
submissions as they came in. We saw tweets, blog posts, and even live
video of vendors working together on code. Dave remembers chatting with
a colleague about how there was all of this activity going on for a
<em>government contract</em>, and that’s when he realized that this was
definitely different from other procurements.</p>

<p><strong>The deadline for the Agile BPA was pushed back several times because
vendors had questions about the process. What were they asking?</strong></p>

<p>Before we answer this, it’s important to understand how RFQs generally
work. After an RFQ is issued, there’s usually an official question and
answer period for vendors to ask questions about the project.</p>

<p>Before the RFQ release, we held a pre-solicitation conference so we
could preview the RFQ to vendors and answer questions, with the goal of
reducing the questions during the official Q&amp;A period. Despite that,
after the release, hundreds more questions still poured in — mostly on
technical or contracting issues. To respond to this volume, we missed
our own answer deadline, and that ended up pushing back the vendors’
deadline to respond.</p>

<p>To be honest, the delay was something that, at the time, really
frustrated the team. But, in hindsight, one of the things we’re most
proud of is how both we learned from the process and plan to be smarter
about it next time around. Our partner FAS helped us move the process
along. By dividing the questions between the contracting officer and the
technical team, we were able to give precise answers — it just took more
time than we expected.</p>

<p>Based on this experience, we learned ways to be smarter about how we
structure the question-and-answer process. We also learned that we could
have done a better job communicating what was going on during that
process. We’re excited for the next round, and will improve on the
experience.</p>

<p><strong>What can you tell us about the review process itself? Was there
anything special about how you approached the technical evaluations?</strong></p>

<p>In some respects, this was our favorite part of the process. Our
evaluation team worked through the proposals with the contracting
officer and his team.</p>

<p>Because we had some of 18F’s own top technical talent involved, we were
able to automate some elements of the technical evaluation that enabled
a faster, more efficient, and more accurate review process for everyone
involved. We’ve also learned a lot about what contracting officers and
other officials — not to mention vendors — experience and hope to
continue to build on some of the things we did in the BPA evaluation
process to make the process easier for everyone.</p>

<p><strong>Now that awards have been made, what should those companies expect
from 18F?</strong></p>

<p>First, they should soon expect to begin seeing opportunities to do what
they do best: deliver working solutions to government customers that
showcase the ability of agile processes to transform the way we buy and
build digital services.</p>

<p>Second, they should expect to maintain an ongoing dialogue with us about
what works and what doesn’t on a project-by-project basis. We view the
vendor community as “users” of the Agile BPA, and their feedback,
knowledge, and insight will help us continue to find ways to innovate
and improve the acquisition process.</p>

<p>Third, they should expect to see us continue to experiment with ways to
improve the procurement process. Our end goal is to reduce the friction
associated with doing business with the government. This allows delivery
teams to focus on the end user experience, driving better solutions at
lower costs.</p>

<p><strong>What about vendors who did not receive awards? Is that it for them?</strong></p>

<p>Not at all. We hope to build in a mechanism to “on-ramp” new vendors who
are interested and able to perform and <em>“</em>off-ramp<em>”</em> vendors who may no
longer be a good fit<em>.</em> This is one of the many concepts that we hope to
test out in the alpha phase, to figure out what makes sense for vendors,
while ensuring that 18F and our customers are getting the highest
quality vendors in the marketplace.</p>

<p><strong>How will the first projects or clients use the vendors that were
awarded the Agile BPA?</strong></p>

<p>Because we still have a lot to learn, we want to start with a few
smaller-scale projects out of the gate, where we can work closely with
our customer agencies and the vendors to observe and measure what works
and what doesn’t throughout the full life cycle of each project. We’ll
gradually expand the number and type of projects to meet demand.</p>

<p><strong>When will the process start?</strong></p>

<p>It’s already started! As any government contracting officer will tell
you, it’s never too early to start good acquisition planning, and we’ve
been doing just that: talking to our in-house delivery and consulting
teams and our agency partners to identify projects that we think are a
good fit.</p>

<p><strong>What are your metrics to measure whether or not the Agile BPA is
successful?</strong></p>

<p>The 18F mantra of “always be shipping” applies here as well. We hope to
see usable code out in the world quickly on all of our projects, which
shows that vendors are using agile principles and methodologies to
deliver stuff their customers want and can use.</p>

<p>Second, we expect to see demand from the marketplace for the Agile BPA
services grow over time.</p>

<h2 id="how-the-bpa-works">How the BPA works</h2>

<p><strong>Why was the BPA competed among existing vendors on GSA IT Schedule
70?</strong></p>

<p>In order to establish a marketplace, we needed access to a broad pool of
vendors, and IT Schedule 70, which sits in FAS ITS, has thousands of
vendors.</p>

<p>A BPA under Schedule 70 gave us significant flexibility to create the
type of contract vehicle we thought we’d want to work with: one that
could be awarded relatively quickly, that would provide for a more
efficient and streamlined ordering process, and that can provide
continued flexibility down the road as we test out what does and doesn’t
work.</p>

<p><strong>As fully envisioned, with this BPA in place, what will it do for
agencies? In other words, how will agencies use it and how will it
benefit them?</strong></p>

<p>Agencies will have access to vendors who use agile practices and focus
on user needs. In our work, we’ve demonstrated that using agile
practices creates more usable and customer-valued software, gives
agencies more flexibility to respond to changes in business priorities
and technology, and is a more efficient use of taxpayer dollars.</p>

<p>We didn’t invent these practices. The industry has been using them
successfully for over a decade. What we’re doing is creating a contract
vehicle featuring agile delivery vendors who can support the IT
acquisition needs of buyers across the federal government.</p>

<p><strong>As it stands now, how does an agency go about finding and purchasing
agile services?</strong></p>

<p>Based on what we’ve seen in the marketplace to date, agencies typically
create new or use existing vehicles local to their organization or
department. This can mean using their own BPAs, or other similar
contract options to get things done. We sometimes describe this as using
their existing “acquisition stack” to figure out what tools are at their
disposal.</p>

<p><strong>And what would the process be if I work at an agency and want to use
the Agile BPA?</strong></p>

<p>Right now, we’re managing this the same as other prospective 18F
projects via our intake team. Agencies should email us at
<a href="mailto:inquiries18f@gsa.gov">inquiries18f@gsa.gov</a> with information
about their problem or project. As we learn more about how to work with
other agencies on the BPA, we will refine the process.</p>

<p><strong>And what’s the process if I’m a vendor and want to get on this Agile
BPA? What can I do?</strong></p>

<p>Please stay tuned! We know you’re out there, and as we get this thing
off the ground, we’ll keep everyone posted on what the on-ramping
process will look like once we’re ready for it.</p>

<p><strong>What sort of companies was the Agile BPA aimed at?</strong></p>

<p>This was aimed at companies that work the way 18F does — in an agile,
user-centered fashion. We were looking for design firms that could turn
around a prototype in just a few weeks, user researchers that could
survey users to provide information before an opening sprint, and
developers that use open source code rather than “reinventing the
wheel.”</p>

<h2 id="a-collaborative-effort-looks-ahead">A collaborative effort looks ahead</h2>

<p><strong>How did 18F work with its sister offices within the General Services
Administration (GSA) on this initiative?</strong></p>

<p>18F and the Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) are partners in this
endeavor, but support for this initiative spans up, down, and across the
organization. We worked closely with a number of people at GSA’s
Southeast Sunbelt Region, including our contracting officer and his
team, to help make the Agile BPA happen. Going forward, FAS contracting
officers in GSA’s Pacific Rim Region will be issuing the task orders on
the BPA. FAS has been talking about the need for federal IT to transform
its approach from waterfall to agile for quite a while.The Agile BPA,
combined with other 18F and FAS procurements, is our to bid make this
change happen on a large scale.</p>

<p><strong>What was FAS’s reaction to some of the things you wanted to do in the
BPA?</strong></p>

<p>We really think that our contracting officer deserves a great deal of
credit for the BPA. He recognized at an early stage that this was going
to be unusual in many respects. Rather than shut it down, though, he
worked hard to understand our goals and to help <em>us</em> understand the
constraints and options. In the end, there were definitely lessons
learned on both sides, but it’s safe to say we could not have done this
without our contracting officer’s willingness to be open and receptive
to our way of doing things.</p>

<p><strong>Could you talk a little bit about how you make the <a href="https://pages.18f.gov/ads-bpa/buyers/">procurements
themselves reflect agile development
practices</a>?</strong></p>

<p>Sure. There are at least three specific examples. First, we expect to be
iterative and test, learn, and refine as we go. Second, we plan to focus
on continuous improvement, and use retrospectives with vendors and
agencies to ensure great results. And third, internally, we’re using
small, cross-functional teams in the preparation of an acquisition under
the BPA through final delivery of the software.</p>

<p><strong>Three years from now, what would be your dream scenario?</strong></p>

<p>A couple of things: that we have a proven track record under the BPA, or
other vehicles, of successful agile delivery projects completed and
available for the world to see and judge for themselves. That we’ve
identified at least a few more successful recipes in the agile delivery
and acquisition cookbook that agencies can implement successfully on
their own. And that we’ve busted at least a few of the myths that the
federal government isn’t a home for digital innovation.</p>

<p><strong>Lastly, why is this important for FAS and 18F?</strong></p>

<p>It’s important for 18F and FAS because it gives us another way to
deliver value for our partner agencies. We recognized at the outset that
the demand for transformative digital services would outpace our ability
to hire people into 18F, and that we’d want to work with industry, an
incredible source of innovation, to help us ship. But, it’s also
important because we have a lot empathy for industry, who are trying to
ship quality software for agency partners, too. By working together, we
can build a contract vehicle that meets our needs, but also aligns with
our vendors’ expectations of how to get things done.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p><img src="/assets/blog/aaron-gustafson/gustafson.jpg" alt="Aaron Gustafson gives a presentation at 18F">
Web standards and accessibility expert Aaron Gustafson was working with
a major drug store chain when he discovered they only tested their
website on iPhones and iPads.</p>

<p>Did they test their site on tablets, Gustafson asked. Specifically, did
the chain know what their site looked like on the $50 tablet they sold
in their own stores?</p>

<p>The store’s response was, “we sell tablets?”</p>

<p>That narrow understanding of the website’s look and feel is a common
issue in contemporary design, and it was the subject of a presentation
Gustafson gave at 18F.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/Fu1L34TLUHM">Watch the entire presentation here.</a></p>

<p>Gustafson hails from the web standards world. He wrote the book
“Adaptive Web Design” and worked for A List Apart before joining
Microsoft. During his talk, he underscored the issues that arise if we
consider sites only through the lens of expensive technology — the
nicest objects with excellent processors.</p>

<p>“It gives us a myopic view of what the mobile web is like for people,”
Gustafson said. “The reality is a lot more messy.”</p>

<p>He challenged designers to improve user experience across browsers and
devices. That means thinking about more than 1,000 different screen
resolutions and a plethora of devices. But it’s an important task,
because designers who think first about upscale cellphones and computers
are forgetting about the web experiences of most Americans.</p>

<p>For example, Pew research shows that smartphone users who make less than
$30,000 a year encounter app errors 52 percent of the time. That means
these users can download apps, but they often won’t open or don’t work.</p>

<p>Gustafson’s solution is progressive enhancement.</p>

<p>“It’s basically building the web, without putting any technical
restrictions on it,” he explained.</p>

<p>Progressive enhancement doesn’t demand that users have modern, updated
browsers. Its only assumption is that website visitors have access to
the internet and some way to read text — either visually or with a
screen reader.</p>

<p>Advanced functionality — like the stylings of CSS and the interactive
features of Javascript — are built on top of that baseline, but they’re
added to the site only when the browser can support it. That way, the
page always works.</p>

<p>“Progressive enhancement offers the user a customized, a la carte
experience,” Gustafson said. “A dynamic web page can never break, it can
only become a web page.”</p>

<p>As an analogy, Gustafson compared progressive enhancement to a peanut
M&amp;M.</p>

<p>The text is the peanut, a fine snack on its own. But with chocolate
(CSS), it’s tastier. And it’s best with colorful candy coating
(Javascript). Ultimately, you can enjoy it at whatever step you get it.</p>

presentation</a></em>.</p>

<p>Alongside his presentation (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/AaronGustafson/beyond-responsive-18f-2015">see the slides
here</a>),
we also had the chance for a more in-depth chat with Aaron (via email)
about design-related topics, including maintaining awareness of our
gadget obsession and recommendations for building a pattern library.
Read on for more from our conversation.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>Note: This interview has been edited and condensed.</em></p>

<p><strong>Kate Garklavs</strong>: What’s the number one obstacle folks encounter as
they adapt their interfaces for mobile, and what actionable tips can you
offer folks facing this challenge?</p>

<p><strong>Aaron Gustafson</strong>: I think coming to terms with the fact that we can’t
control everything is a struggle for many designers. The web is quite
different from any other medium in that we have little to no control
over how our content reaches our audiences. A number of factors affect
the final product: the network, the browser, the device, screen size,
amount of RAM, processor speed, assistive technology in use, and so on.
When you begin to think of experience as a continuum rather than some
monolithic ideal, you start to see these as constraints that help you
focus on what matters rather than annoyances you have to work around.</p>

<p><strong>Kate</strong>: <a href="http://webstandardssherpa.com/ask-the-sherpas/apple-products-and-mobile-assumptions">You’ve
mentioned</a>
that we (people working in tech) must remain aware of our fondness for
the latest, greatest gadgets in order to design well for diverse
audiences. How can people stress the importance of this outlook — and
make sure it’s represented in workflows — in an organization that might
not share this view?</p>

<p><strong>Aaron</strong>: This is a real challenge for many organizations. It’s helpful
to find real people (rather than avatars) to represent the different
constituencies you’re trying to reach. Real people with real challenges
are always more relatable and often foster more situational empathy.
Beyond that, it’s sometimes helpful to overwhelm certain people with
data regarding device proliferation and diversity. <a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2015/08/05/this-is-what-android-fragmentation-looks-like-in-2015/"><em>The Next
Web’s</em>
recent report on Android
fragmentation</a>
is a great example of this.</p>

<p><strong>Kate:</strong> What recommendations would you give to someone building a
pattern library for the first time?</p>

<p><strong>Aaron</strong>: Start small. Look for simple, repeatable patterns and codify
those first. Then add to the library bit by bit. In an ideal world, I
like to have a large team working on the pattern library, with different
team members responsible for a handful of patterns. If each pattern is
&quot;owned&quot; by a small sub-team consisting of folks from different
disciplines — content strategy, design, development — the end result is
often better than if one person makes the patterns and other have to
implement them. Ownership is important because it gets people invested
in the library and ensures they’ll use it. And by having each small team
focus on a handful of patterns, they can be on the constant lookout for
ways to improve and iterate on them.</p>

<p><strong>Kate</strong>: A more personal question: Do you apply principles of
progressive enhancement to non-work aspects of your life?</p>

<p><strong>Aaron</strong>: I think the most obvious way I apply progressive enhancement
in my life is by trying to be as egalitarian as I can in the things I
do. I think equality of opportunity is important, but so is the
understanding that equality of outcome is not always possible or even
desirable. It’s important to be adaptable and roll with the punches as
it were. I’m a big fan of the saying, &quot;We cannot control what happens in
this world, we can only control our reaction to it.&quot; Those are words I
try to live by.</p>

<p><strong>Kate</strong>: What sites, people or resources do you turn to for
inspiration?</p>

<p><strong>Aaron</strong>: I’m a big fan of Jeremy Keith’s work when it comes to
big-picture web stuff. I also find Bruce Lawson, Christian Heilmann, and
Tim Kadlec to be quite insightful. There’s really no beating Sara
Soueidan when it comes to learning about SVG. I also love the
presentations and writings of Stephen Hay, Zoe Mickley Gillenwater, and
Lyza Danger Gardner.</p>

<p><strong>Kate</strong>: Finally, what one piece of advice would you offer new
designers?</p>

<p><strong>Aaron</strong>: I can’t pick just one, so I’ll give you two: My first piece
of advice is to take the time to really understand the web as a medium.
It can take some time, but will make you a better designer. My second
piece of advice is to be flexible, not only in the way you design but in
how you think about your process and how you view the results of your
work. These two pieces of advice will serve you well in the long run.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>We’re immensely happy to hear that the president has issued an executive order
ensuring the Presidential Innovation Fellows program has a permanent place in our government. The program began in 2012 as a pilot, and 18F was later founded by several former Presidential Innovation Fellows.
See the <a href="http://gsablogs.gsa.gov/gsablog/2015/08/17/creating-a-culture-of-lasting-innovation-continuous-improvement/">General Service Administration&#39;s blog post about the announcement</a> below for more information.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>By Denise Turner Roth, GSA Administrator and Garren Givens, Program
Director, Presidential Innovation Fellows</em></p>

<p>Today, President Obama <a href="https://medium.com/@WhiteHouse/meet-the-presidential-innovation-fellows-194dec20442b">announced an executive
order</a>
that formally establishes the Presidential Innovation Fellows program,
and houses it within the walls of U.S. General Services Administration
(GSA). The program is made up of a diverse group of proven innovators
from around the country who serve as partners to policy and domain
experts already working within government.</p>

<p>While the program provides a unique experience for the men and women
selected, the primary objective is to create a more responsive
government; one that continually leverages the best principles and
practices to deliver better, more effective government programs and
policies. In technology, we refer to this as “continuous improvement” —
the virtuous process of designing, developing, and iterating based on
end-users, not government stakeholders.</p>

<p>In just a few short years, fellows and their federal partners have made
large gains on a number of complex challenges that impact millions of
Americans. They’ve done so by starting small, and iterating early and
often. In addition, fellows have relied on “validated learning” to drive
decisions about where to deploy resources, like time, effort, and
taxpayer money.</p>

<h2 id="best-practices-from-the-private-sector">Best Practices from the Private Sector</h2>

<p>Among the best examples of the work coming out of the program are the
pilot and subsequent platforms the Fellows launched to improvement
procurement. Beginning in 2012, the first team of fellows launched a
pilot focused on making it easier for private sector to learn about and
compete for government contracts.</p>

<p>Critical feedback from this pilot showed that greater transparency led
to more competitive bids, benefitting both the agencies and the
taxpayers they serve. This led to the development of <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/rfpez/">several
platforms</a>, now in beta, that build on these
learnings and are challenging us to think differently about how we
engage the private sector.</p>

<p>Each of these platforms was developed to minimize the upfront cost
necessary to evaluate effectiveness, and determine whether to invest or
iterate further. If successful, not only will we succeed in ensuring
agencies have access to the best possible services and solutions at
competitive prices, but small and medium-sized technology companies will
be better positioned than ever to compete for the huge sum the federal
government spends on information technology.</p>

<h2 id="leveraging-the-power-of-the-people">Leveraging the Power of the People</h2>

<p>Another powerful strategy focuses on crowdsourcing solutions, where
government acts as a platform on which entrepreneurs, startups, and the
private sector can build value-added services and tools on top of
federal datasets supported by federal policies. Taking this approach,
fellows and their federal partners have spurred the creation of new
products and services focused on education, health, the environment,
social justice, and much more.</p>

<p>For example, fellows worked with the Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS) to launch the <a href="http://www.healthit.gov/patients-families/blue-button/about-blue-button">Blue Button
Initiative</a>,
which is helping Americans across the country gain secure, online access
to their own healthcare information. Now, more than 150 million
Americans can use Blue Button-enabled tools to access at least one
source of their personal health data from the nation’s top pharmacies,
health providers around the country, insurance companies, and labs.</p>

<h2 id="improving-digital-services-across-government">Improving Digital Services Across Government</h2>

<p>To date, the Presidential Innovation Fellows have played key roles in
establishing both <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a>, an innovative consulting
and agile delivery team, and the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service">United States Digital
Services</a>,
a team built to improve the infrastructure and user experience around
some of the most important services. All are working to reinvent the
transactions that affect us in our everyday lives, such as accessing
healthcare and benefits, securing and managing student loans, and
applying for citizenship.</p>

<p>These teams have attracted almost 200 new innovators and technologists
to government to help catalyze the change they’d like to see. And on the
ground, agencies like the Department of Commerce, the Department of
Veterans Affairs, the Environmental Protection Agency, and many more,
have built their own teams. All are working to inculcate these values
into their government through recruiting, training, and of course,
delivery. To make it last, we must turn our focus on retaining great
talent that can help develop our existing federal workforce of
passionate bureaucrats into champions of innovation and reinvention.</p>

<h2 id="innovation-as-a-shared-service">Innovation as a Shared Service</h2>

<p>In placing the Presidential Innovation Fellows program at GSA, the goal
is to capitalize on the agency’s experience in delivering shared
acquisition and IT services across the entire federal government and arm
great innovators from inside and outside government with the tools
needed to improve the lives of the people we serve. This work is never
done.</p>

<p>And this, we hope, will be the true legacy of the Presidential
Innovation Fellows program; that the notion of continuous improvement
will not be limited to services we create and provide, but will extend
to government itself; that we will continue to evolve to meet the
challenges and opportunities relevant to our time, and that we will
strive to always represent our best self – built on the most innovative
thinking, in service to the needs of the people.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p><a href="https://methods.18f.gov/"><img src="/assets/blog/design-method-cards/method-cards-banner.jpg" alt="A sampling of the 18F Design Method cards"></a></p>

<p>We’re thrilled to introduce the beta deck of <a href="https://methods.18f.gov/">18F Design
Methods</a>, a collection of research and design
practices that we use to better understand and serve the users of our
products.</p>

<p>It&#39;s amazing to think that this project started off as something folks
did in their spare time — those odd minutes between meetings and at the
end of the day — and to see how far it has come. What began as an
opportunity for 18F to communicate more clearly across teams turned into
something a little bigger. We realized that gathering and organizing our
design methods could help us keep improving our shared understanding of
how we work together.</p>

<p>We realized, too, that these practices could benefit groups beyond 18F:
our partners and clients within the federal government, state-level
agencies practicing user-centered design, startups and businesses
everywhere, and people interested in learning these techniques.
Encouraged by the value this collection of methods can offer (and the
further learning we hope they&#39;ll spark), we&#39;re sharing them as broadly
as we can.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-got-started">How we got started</h2>

<p>When the research guild — a group of 18F’s user experience researchers
and designers — first conceptualized these Design Methods, we had no
idea what the project would become. The undertaking started as a
“hackathon” project (something to be completed within a day or two) but
evolved to become a four-month project with a rotating cast of team
members contributing their efforts.</p>

<p>We hoped the finished product would do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Offer an easy introduction to some of our favorite research and design methods to everyone who’s interested (inside and outside 18F).</li>
<li>  Create a shared vocabulary across designers and project teams, and eventually (we hope) across the federal government.</li>
<li>  Show how government agencies — including those without dedicated design teams — can do quick, comparatively low-cost user research to understand what citizens need while respecting federal regulations, like the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opcl/overview-privacy-act-1974-2015-edition">Privacy Act</a> and the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ13/html/PLAW-104publ13.htm">Paperwork Reduction Act</a>.</li>
<li>  Remove barriers that prevent designers from including tested methods into their design process.</li>
<li>  Provide just enough guidance to give designers the confidence to put a method into practice.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-they-were-made">How they were made</h2>

<p>The project was born from the realization that, while some of our team
members have extensive knowledge of design methods, others have no idea
where to start. Our initial intent was to create a tool to help people
become more conversant in common design practices and start practicing
them. Often knowing that a method exists, what it’s intent is, and how
it’s done is enough to get started.</p>

<p>To understand how method cards might help product teams, we conducted
one-on-one interviews with design leads across roughly 10 projects. We
asked them about the techniques they used and any changes they’d made to
enable these to work within government. We also spoke with developers
and product managers to get an understanding of how they thought about
the design and research they conducted.</p>

<p>Constantly shipping products and testing them out is part of how we
work, so right away we designed and printed several
<a href="https://methods.18f.gov/prototyping/">prototype</a> sets of alpha
(initial-stage) method cards to get some quick feedback on our concept.
The cards sat around our D.C. and San Francisco offices with signs
asking colleagues to try them out and send us their feedback. We also
conducted a few more formal <a href="https://methods.18f.gov/usability-testing/">usability
tests</a> of the card decks,
which led to some changes in the beta version.</p>

<p>Beyond learning what people thought of the cards, we wanted to see how
receiving a set would change people’s behavior. To find this out, we ran
18F’s first randomized, controlled experiment to measure how receiving a
set of method cards affected people&#39;s knowledge and comfort with our
design methods. Our research showed that 18F teammates who received
cards were slightly more knowledgeable and comfortable with methods than a
control group whose members didn’t receive cards. (We’ll report more on
this in a future blog post — stay tuned.)</p>

<h2 id="get-your-own-deck">Get your own deck</h2>

<p>Our design methods are available in two formats:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>A <a href="https://methods.18f.gov/assets/downloads/18F-Method-Cards-beta-Preview.pdf">printed card deck</a> for quick reference.</strong> With printed cards, you can compare different methods side by side, and physically pull together the methods you’re interested in.</li>
<li><strong>An <a href="https://methods.18f.gov/">online version</a> for more information.</strong> Our “alpha” digital version provides more details about each method, short stories about how we’ve used a given method in our work, and links to additional resources. You also download our <a href="https://methods.18f.gov/assets/downloads/18F-Method-Cards-beta-Template.zip">templates</a> and <a href="https://methods.18f.gov/assets/downloads/18F-Method-Cards-beta_Print.zip">printable PDFs</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="principles-that-are-and-are-not-here">Principles that are and are not here</h2>

<p>Every project has a different design process. Our method cards respect
that. We’re purposely <strong>not</strong> offering a suggested order or set of
methods. Rather, we’d like users to think of these cards as a palette of
methods to pick and choose from. Both the online and print versions of
the cards are grouped into phases. These aren’t a set of steps each our
projects goes through sequentially, but modes that every projects goes
in and out of. Bottom line: Use the cards in whatever way yields the
greatest benefit to your team.</p>

<p>There are several excellent decks of method cards out there, but none
that we have found are tailored to doing design work in the government.
Our cards offer guidance to anyone in the federal government wanting to
do user-centered design. For the most part, the processes we use are the
same as those used in the private sector. However, we have additional
considerations, legal and otherwise. To stay on the happy side of the
law, take a look at <a href="https://methods.18f.gov/recruiting/">Recruiting</a>,
<a href="https://methods.18f.gov/incentives/">Incentives</a>, <a href="https://methods.18f.gov/informed-consent/">Informed
consent</a>,
<a href="https://methods.18f.gov/privacy/">Privacy</a>, and the <a href="https://methods.18f.gov/paperwork-reduction-act/">Paperwork
Reduction Act</a>. No
matter which methods we work with, these are the
<a href="https://methods.18f.gov/fundamentals/">fundamentals</a> of our design
research.</p>

<p>Like everything we do at 18F, our method cards are entirely open source.
That means you can <a href="https://github.com/18F/methods">clone, fork, modify, and
improve</a> both the online and physical
versions of the cards. If you have access to InDesign, you can also
<a href="https://methods.18f.gov/assets/downloads/18F-Method-Cards-beta-Template.zip">customize our
template</a>
to fit your own needs and make your own card set. We can’t wait to see
what you do with them!</p>

<h2 id="what’s-next">What’s next</h2>

<p>It’s our sincere hope that people will freely take and use the method
cards we’ve created. Our team put a lot of care into this first release,
and we look forward to collecting feedback that will help us continue
the effort and allow us to improve our work as we go. We know we
couldn’t include everything in this version — in fact, we’re just
getting started. We’re incredibly proud of what our project team has
researched, crafted, tested, and improved upon. Everyone pitched in when
they could, and the output is something we are all proud of.</p>

<em>Source:</em> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/usoceangov/8290528771/"><strong>National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration</strong></a></p>

<p>Technical debt is a financial metaphor that software developers use to
talk to managers about the “hidden” costs associated with a system’s
architecture and codebase (for example, changing requirements addressed
with a “quick fix,” bugs deferred in favor of new development, design
weaknesses, or aging third-party libraries). Technical debt costs
organizations time as well as money. <a href="http://www.castsoftware.com/research-labs/technical-debt-estimation">Recent
studies</a>,
seeking to estimate the financial impact, suggest that an average
technical debt of $3.61 exists per line of software code, or an average
of $1.08 million per system. In 2010, <a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/1439513">Gartner
estimated</a> that the total
amount of technical debt worldwide could reach $1 trillion this year.
Given that the federal government builds and maintains a lot of
software, it’s safe to assume that it carries a fair share of that debt.</p>

<h2 id="why-care-about-the-government’s-technical-debt?">Why care about the government’s technical debt?</h2>

<p>Technical debt can make software resistant and costly to change, and
prone to outages, intermittent failures, and even <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/it-security/be-careful-not-to-incur-security-debt/">security
breaches</a>.</p>

<p>For users, this means fixes or features they need take more time to
implement. For taxpayers, this means inefficient use of their
hard-earned dollars. For program managers, this means greater risk that
their debt-ridden systems become so untenable that they have to be
ditched and rebuilt from scratch. For chief information officers, this
means less budget and resource capacity to work on innovative projects
that add value to their business partners. And for agency executives,
this means systems that can’t be easily adapted to deliver new business
capabilities, nor relied upon to support critical mission operations.</p>

<p>As stewards of taxpayer dollars and servants to the needs of the public,
it&#39;s our responsibility to avoid such issues by understanding what
technical debt is and how to manage it.</p>

<p>Over a series of upcoming posts, we’re going to explain what technical
debt is (and why it’s not all bad), how to manage it, and some ways to
prevent accumulating it. At the end of the series, you’ll have a clear
understanding of technical debt and how to handle it.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>We’ve all been there. You walk into a meeting, set your things on the
table, and sit down on the chair only to hit the floor instead. In a
corporate office you might buy a new chair and get reimbursed, or maybe
your company has a process for requesting new furniture. Regardless,
that chair needs replacing.</p>

<p>In the government, the system to replace something small like an office
chair revolves around credit cards, called “purchase cards,” paid by the
government and used by specially trained employees. In 2014, about
265,000 federal employees held purchase cards. They made <a href="https://smartpay.gsa.gov/about-gsa-smartpay/program-statistics">more than 20
million transactions totaling more than $17 billion dollars</a> for items <a href="https://smartpay.gsa.gov/program-coordinators/smartpay-charge-cards/purchase-card/how-it-works">that cost less than $3,000</a>. Regulations require
that these “micro-purchases” be reviewed to ensure federal employees are
properly spending taxpayer money.</p>

<p>To buy that new office chair, a federal employee needs to justify the
purchase to an approving official and have a budget analyst ensure funds
are available. All of that work is supposed to happen fast for
micro-purchases — it’s hard to get work done without a chair — but until
recently there were no standard tools the employee, the approver, or the
analyst could use to manage and track these requests. Most of that work
is done over email, which, while electronic, places the burden of
tracking on the employee. If you need a chair, it’s on you to figure out
how to keep track of your request through this process. Over time these
inconsistencies became inefficiencies that slowed down the whole
process. With our partners at the General Service Administration&#39;s
Public Buildings Service in Washington, D.C., we’ve started building a
tool to help make this process fast and efficient.</p>

<p><a href="https://cap.18f.gov/"><img src="/assets/blog/communicart/communicart-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of the Communicart approval portal"></a></p>

<p>We call it <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/dashboard/project/C2/">Communicart</a>.
It’s a tool that took some cues from the process for tracking “carts”
through an approval process on <a href="https://www.gsaadvantage.gov/advantage/main/start_page.do">GSA Advantage</a>, a site government
employees use to shop at special rates. Our hope is that as this tool
streamlines the purchase card approval process, government employees can
spend more time performing their essential work and less time on the
paperwork required to buy that new chair. An updated process will also
help restore public confidence that government employees are only using
cards for valid purchases. We’re excited to begin rolling it out to
Public Buildings Service employees across the country.</p>

<p>We <a href="https://github.com/18f/C2">built Communicart in the open</a> and listened carefully to our
users throughout the process. We’ve heard people say things like “this
system is awesome,” and even got asked “when do the angels sing?” We’re
excited to see how this product grows.</p>

<p>In the past, building a system like this would take months or even years
to build a list of technical requirements, put it out for bidding, then
wait for a finished product. By working in an agile fashion with 18F, in
just a few weeks, GSA had the initial concept built and was able to get
immediate feedback from the people who would actually be using this
tool. Early feedback helped drive Communicart’s development, and saved
time and taxpayer dollars by catching problems while they were small and
easy to mitigate</p>

<p>Below is a visualization of our team’s development work, as displayed by
tracking their code in GitHub. If you’re interested in the code you can
learn more in the project’s <a href="https://github.com/18f/C2">GitHub repository</a>. To learn more about
Communicart, check out our <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/dashboard/project/C2/">Dashboard</a> where we have information on
the code behind the project, review the <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/18f/cap-communicart-18f-demo-day-9-may-2014">slides from our first demo
day</a> showing off an early prototype, and check out <a href="https://cap.18f.gov/">the Communicart
product page</a>.</p>

<p>We’ll be blogging more about Communicart, how we built it, and who is
using it in the next few weeks. We have all the beta testers we can
handle right now, but if you’re interested in getting involved in the
future, <a href="mailto:gatewaycommunicator@gsa.gov">drop us a line</a>.</p>

<p><em>Correction:</em> An earlier version of this post stated that Communicart&#39;s national rollout would begin in the General Services Administration&#39;s Great Lakes Region (Region 5). The National Capital Region (Region 11) launched Communicart in early July.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>We routinely publish our best practices in the <a href="https://pages.18f.gov/guides/">18F Guides</a>, and today we’re happy to launch a new one: the <a href="https://pages.18f.gov/open-source-guide/">18F Open Source Style Guide</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/open-source-guide/screenshot-of-guide.png" alt="Screenshot of Open Source Guide"></p>

<p>The Open Source Style Guide is a comprehensive handbook for writing clear, accessible, and user-friendly documentation so that your open source code repositories are accessible both internally and externally.</p>

<p>It’s important to make sure our documentation is clear both for internal and external audiences. As our team expands, we want our new employees to easily find and use our existing codebases.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also really important if we want to make outside contributors feel welcome or have outside organizations fork and use our code. (<a href="https://github.com/18F/open-source-policy/blob/master/policy.md">And we do!</a>) Explaining what a project is, why it&#39;s important, and how people can help ensures that people can fork and adapt our projects.</p>

<p>This guide also contains a checklist we created that helps ensure our repos are clear, accessible, and user-friendly. Some terminology used may be GitHub-specific, but the concepts are applicable regardless of your version control system or platform. We wrote it so that both non-coders and coders can understand it. (If something is not clear, please <a href="https://github.com/18F/open-source-guide/issues/new">let us know</a>.)</p>

<p>We’re sharing it because it we think it’s helpful for lots of organizations, including our own. We know that many of our repos don’t conform to this exact style. By articulating a specific style, we hope this document will also help us improve our own practices.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-this-guide">How to use this guide</h2>

<p>We created this guide for reference on an as-needed basis. It’s here when you’re wondering how to describe a repo, for instance, or when you’re wondering how to create a friendly, informational tone when writing issues for users. To this end, we’ve structured the guide into descriptively named sections. Browse our table of contents to find the topic you’re looking for.</p>

<h2 id="the-guide-is-a-living-thing">The guide is a living thing</h2>

<p>Most importantly, we encourage you to make a copy of this document and adapt it to your organizational needs. This guide is just that: a guide. It’s not meant to provide the final opinion on any of the topics discussed. If a certain section isn’t relevant to you and your team, delete it. And if you feel the guide is missing a section, by all means, add it. This guide is yours to use, and we trust you’ll update it in the ways that best suit you.</p>

<h2 id="now-taking-suggestions">Now taking suggestions</h2>

<p>If you’ve got thoughts on how we might improve the guide, please <a href="https://github.com/18F/open-source-guide">send them our way</a> — we’d love to hear from you!</p>
